### part 4: summary writing

@speaker1 had a quick, solo session to troubleshoot _a recording issue_. the entire five minutes were spent trying to figure out why the recording system wasn't showing any data, even though the recording seemed to be working.  @speaker1 tried a few different things, like playing a youtube video to test the multi-speaker function, ðŸŸ but unfortunately, nothing solved the problem. ðŸŸ  the tension was palpable as @speaker1 kept checking the screen and voicing his frustration that the "cost still shows zero".  ðŸ”µhe remained focused on solving the problem, showing both ðŸŸ concern and ðŸ”µdetermination.  the meeting ended with the _main issue_ unresolved.  there were no clear next steps defined.


### part 5: advanced insights
**the one key thing:** the recording system was malfunctioning. the main issue was the display of zero cost despite the recording seemingly running.
