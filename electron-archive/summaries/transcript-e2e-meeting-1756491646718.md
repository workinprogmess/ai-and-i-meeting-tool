[0:00-0:15] initial setup and discussion of play button placement ðŸ”µðŸŸ 
@speaker1 expresses concern about the current placement of the play button.  There's a slight tension around finding the optimal position.

[0:00] @speaker1: "....mujhe lag raha hai ki..." (i think that...)
(Initial observation about the play button's positioning)

[0:05] @speaker1: "....play wale mein thoda..." (a little bit in the play...)
(More specific concern about the play button)


[0:15-0:45]  focus shifts to the play button connection and card tap ðŸ”µ
The conversation centers on connecting the play button and making sure that tapping the card activates the play function.  The mood is focused and task-oriented.

[0:15] @speaker1: "...play wale ko connect karta hu..." (i'm connecting the play button)
(Working on technical aspects)

[0:20] @speaker1: "isse baad card pe tap karo toh woh play wala..." (after this, when you tap the card, the play button...)
(Explaining the functionality)

[0:45-1:15] placement of play button and card click ðŸ”µðŸŸ 
Discussion continues on placing the play button and a card click functionality.  Slight concern remains as @speaker1 is still working on the positioning.


[0:45] @speaker1: "play button introduce kar de upar" (introduce the play button above)
(suggesting a new position)

[1:15-2:00] play button aesthetics and placement ðŸŸ 
@speaker1 isn't fully satisfied with the play button's visual appeal.  The discussion turns more towards the aesthetics than the functionality.

[1:15] @speaker1:  "play button bilkul use karu jo apne pass icon hai, aur koi nayya icon..."  (i'll use the play button icon we already have, not a new one)
(preference for existing icon)

[2:00-2:45]  adjusting spacing and positioning (48, card size) ðŸ”µ
The focus is on resolving spacing issues around element "48" and the card's size.  The tone is problem-solving.

[2:00] @speaker1: "abhi 16 16 hai upar se..." (it's 16 16 from the top)
(measuring space)

[2:10] @speaker1: "actually 16 nahi na... arjun ko kitna space diya hai tune arjun..." (actually, not 16, how much space did you give arjun...)
(adjusting space for element "arjun")

[2:30] @speaker1: "thodi sa na isko card ko bada kar de so that 48 ko bhi... card ko bhi sabko thodi thodi space mil jaye" (make the card a bit bigger so that 48 also gets some space, and the card as well)
(proposed solution)

[2:45-3:30] fine tuning the card's height and positioning ðŸ”µ
Further adjustments are made to the card's vertical sizing and placement. The problem-solving continues in a focused manner.

[2:45] @speaker1: "card ko vertically stretch karna hai" (we need to stretch the card vertically)

[3:30-4:00]  checking card height and final adjustments ðŸ”µðŸŸ¢
They check the card's height and make final adjustments. A sense of resolution is starting to emerge.

[3:30] @speaker1: "sahi hai card ki height?" (is the card height correct?)

[3:35] @speaker2: "222 hai abhi" (it's 222 right now)

[4:00-4:15] final positioning and centering ðŸŸ¢
The final positioning is confirmed, and they focus on centering the element "48".  The mood is resolved, the task is almost complete.

[4:00] @speaker1: "48 thoda sa niche kar de so it comes in the center" (let's move 48 a bit down so it's centered)
