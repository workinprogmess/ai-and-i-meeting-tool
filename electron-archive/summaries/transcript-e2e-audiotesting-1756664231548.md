[00:00] @me: Uh, I'm on with my AirPods and we're going to follow a similar pattern um with my uh you know, with me talking about some things. I'm going to test uh AirPods on and um after that I'll go on to record a system, you know, uh to get a video for a system audio check with AirPods. Then I'm going to remove my AirPods, uh do the microphone check then and the system audio check again. That was it completes our sequence of things. And meanwhile we'll see the time timestamps and speaker identification uh at the transcript level is happening because I think the last time there was a dual stream mix up. I think they were not starting simultaneously. We put the timestamps that mixed up and we'll be missed up on the transcripts. So now we fix that and you know, made some instructions a bit clearer to Google as well. Um anyways, um so this is it. Now I'm going to go ahead and probably play a YouTube video uh sometime.
[00:58] @speaker1:  Record.
[00:59] @speaker2: Hey, Clark.
[01:00] @speaker1: Hey, Jim.
[01:01] @speaker1: Did you uh
[01:08] @speaker1: who are you?
[01:10] @speaker2: Hey, Clark.
[01:11] @speaker1: Hey, Jim.
[01:12] @speaker1: Did you uh
[01:19] @speaker1: who are you?
[01:21] @speaker1: Record.
[01:26] @speaker1: You want me to be happy with a measly 12% on average return when I need to come up now. I need to come up now. Look at these returns. If I if I was dumb and I invested in VTSAX, I get 12%. But look, if 10 years ago, I go all in on the real stuff that makes the world turn. I just all I do is I hold Fang plus Nvidia. Meta, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Google and Nvidia. I would have gone up 713%, 873%, 633%, 1,268%. JL, had I put my $3,000 into Nvidia, I would have gone up 26,209% in 10 years. So  your 12%. JL.
[02:38] @speaker2: That's amazing. And if you had wings, you could fly. So what crystal ball did you have 10 years ago that told you that?
[02:50] @speaker1: I don't I I just Oh, oh, oh, oh. I don't have one. Oh, oh, oh. Well, yeah, obviously, if you knew that was going to happen. If I knew that Bitcoin was going to go from a penny a coin to $100,000, I would have sold everything and gone into Bitcoin. The thing is, you don't know that's going to happen. And there's a lot of stocks that looked every bit as promising as those that you put up 10 years ago that flamed out and went to nothing. You would have wound up broke. You don't know which horse is going to win. But I do know that VTSAX will reliably make me wealthy. And 12% a year compounded over time, 8% a year, let's be much more conservative, compounded over time is an extraordinarily powerful thing.
[03:57] @speaker1: I don't want me
