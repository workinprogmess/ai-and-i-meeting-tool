@me: this time I made several changes to the prompt, I'm using Gemini to approach from two audio player within model. So the so the recordings play simultaneously and you're alternating between speakers instead of following audio quality and devices, etcetera. Following step by and we also made a step-by-step algorithm. Uh maybe it's even more clear there, but I think it should work still. Um and Gemini should be able to maintain our chronological progression throughout the whole bit. Good thing is recording most of it. Uh but it's the chronology that we are struggling with. And now and I'm hearing still speaking a lot at my and then there is system audio and then I'm speaking and then but the actual meetings were actually very very fast where in you know different speakers you know they just talk. So capturing and making sense of uh that uh in the way that it has happened is going to be even more complex. But I'm I'm wondering like what's the what's the 2025 is there a way for us to go beyond 2025 the real time thing. I guess. But is but doesn't mean like but can why can't we do real time with this like right now like can we do real time with what we have instead of let's go to the maybe it looks better even today. I don't know. I'm going to go back and explore real time. But this if let's say Gemini continues to struggle maybe it still just prompting better prompting. I don't know. Uh uh I'm going to go ahead and record a YouTube video. I'm going to keep it short because I'm already close to 2 minutes. Okay, I'm going to look for a new video to play. Okay, what is this? It's about a new design tool that's killing Figma Make. Okay.  @speaker1: Hey everyone, welcome to today's video. My name is Lucas. Now we all know about Figma, right? It's the king of the design tools I would have to say, especially in this year 2025. And not only is it great at all things UX UI design, but you can use it to create like custom presentations or like edit PDFs or heck I even use it for my thumbnails for my videos. But Figma not only just offers that, Figma also has something called Figma Make, which is basically like a prompt to design tool, something similar to like Lovable for example. And just because Figma Make has the Figma brand name on it doesn't make it the best AI design tool. So in today's video what I want to do is I want to do like a comparison video where I have Figma Make do the same thing as the competitor does, which is Magic Path and show you how this competitor outweighs Figma Make in many different factors. Anyways, before we dive into the video, I'd love to invite you guys to my Discord community @me: Let's see how it goes. We've switched to uh I can see we've switched to my microphone built-in, which means that my voice should be recorded. It isn't even being recorded. It's just that one built-in, which means that my voice should be recorded. It isn't even being recorded. It's just that the way uh again I would say it's the order of things that we are struggling with. So order of things that we are struggling with. So now thing is uh now thing is uh I'm going to go ahead and play another YouTube video. Um I'm going to go ahead and play another YouTube video. Probably continue the same uh and probably continue the same uh and let's say here. Let's go. So anyways, right @speaker1: So anyways, right from the get-go we have two different faces here. On the left side we have Figma Make and on the right side we have magicpath.ai. And something that you can instantly see in Figma Make is that you have a very similar layout as all of the other different AI tools. You have on the left side a chat panel and on the right side you have something where you would expect to see your design. On the other hand, in Magic Path we have a completely different type of call to action here. Double click anywhere to create a new design or click the plus button. So I'm just going to go ahead and just double click. And as you can see, I can zoom in and kind of like move around freely in this infinite canvas view. And already right off the bat I would have to say that Magic Path wins in this remark because it basically allows you to build flows and layouts freely without any strict constraints like with these other tools. So I can continue double clicking and double clicking and double clicking and I get all of these different canvases and I can just move them around freely. I can even organize them to look like a grid view. I can make some of them wider than others for example and I can even adjust like the colors in the background. So I can make it like a dark mode. I can make it like gray with a dotted texture. So me, you know, with this kind of visual learning style or or you know, me having this need to express my ideas in a type of free mode, this is just perfect for me. Anyways, going @me: Okay. Uh I'm going to see a last few lines again. So I just want to see like after Okay. Uh I'm going to see a last few lines again. So I just want to see like after the second video without AirPods if it captures in the same order again.  @me: What I'm saying that I played two videos I recorded myself with AirPods minus AirPods and I really hope to see it capturing in the way it happened. Minus AirPods and I really hope to see it capturing in the way it happened. Okay? Thank you.  @speaker1: Seven
