[0:00-10:00] @speaker1 reads a blog post about a new framework for AI product development. ðŸ”µ

the tone is informative and slightly technical, focused on explaining the "ccccd" framework.  there's a moment of self-doubt about the length and engagement of the reading.

[0:00] @speaker1: "ten fifteen minutes and i wanna go and read a blog a long time pending article on if i can essay on why your ai product needs a different developmental cycle using the cccd framework, continuous calibration continuous development..."
(introductory statement setting context for what will be a technical explanation)


[0:10] @speaker1: "...ai product managers building shipping or building shipping ai features probably felt this your company's under pressure to launch something with ai..."
(sets a relatable context for the technical discussion that follows)


[0:20-3:00] @speaker1 explains the first key difference between AI and traditional software: AI products are inherently non-deterministic. ðŸ”µ

he details how user interaction and system responses are less predictable in AI, leading to challenges in traditional development approaches.

[3:00] @speaker1: "...ai systems behave differently, they introduce non-determinism on both ends...in other words there's unpredictability in how users engage and how our systems respond..."
(clearly explains the first key differentiating factor between AI and traditional software)

[3:00-5:00] @speaker1 explains the second key difference: the trade-off between agency and control in AI systems. ðŸ”µ

he discusses how increasing an AI's agency requires careful testing to avoid loss of control and trust.

[5:00] @speaker1: "every product negotiates a trade-off between agency and control...there's another layer that makes ai systems different and it's one we rarely had to think about before with traditional software products, agency..."
(explains the crucial concept of agency vs control in ai systems)


[5:00-7:00] @speaker1 introduces the CCCC-D framework (continuous calibration continuous development) as a solution to the challenges of building AI products. ðŸ”µ

he highlights the framework's iterative nature, emphasizing the need for continuous calibration and gradual increase of AI agency.

[7:00] @speaker1: "...to help navigate this these distinctions we called it cccd, continuous collaboration continuous development...the names in reference to continuous integration continuous deployment cicd but unlike its namesake it's meant for systems whose behaviour is not..."
(introduces the solution and highlights how it differs from traditional cicd)

[7:00-10:00] @speaker1 breaks down the steps of the CCCC-D framework: scope, design evaluations, deploy, run evaluations, analyze behaviors, and apply fixes.  ðŸ”µ

the explanation is detailed, focusing on iterative development and continuous calibration. There is a slight ðŸŸ  concern expressed about the length and engagement of the material at the end of this section.

[9:00] @speaker1: "...interesting...but boring, probably could've been better, i don't know, it's still it's only ten minutes now...should i go on, maybe, just saying like where do where do we go from here, or putting it all together, okay..."
(self reflection on the presentation)


[10:00-End] @speaker1  further explains the framework, emphasizing the importance of iterative development, gradual increase in AI agency and the need for carefully designed evaluation metrics.  ðŸ”µ

there's a further moment of self-doubt regarding the length and delivery of the information, ending with an abrupt cut-off.
