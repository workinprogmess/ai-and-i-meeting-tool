[05:46] @speaker1: Okay.
[06:25] @speaker2: dreaming the itch meetings on only words. They are undercurrents of emotion power hesitation conviction. Today's notes note takers today's note takers capture syllables but miss the pulse and miss the pulse and then and they file every meeting in its own lonely folder. The result is a library of well-formatted well-formatted trivia well-formatted trivia that still forces you to stitch the context by hand. Your lens that weaves patterns across time and shows the feeling beneath the phrasing. The question is whether building that lens is vision or mirror.

With a toddler we can't deal with uncertainties of life. we are dealing with uncertainties of life. Are chal na yaar kaam karne de usko chal. Reporting to KB is much easier. no. theek hai to main figma pe aata hu project ban gaya apna. Main tesse puch raha tha ha usko na private project karte hain just share it with uh you and me. like settings uh I think bas aap hi ko invite kiya hai to baaki to waise bhi shayad nahi dekh payenge right? nahi matlab if they are in the workspace they can see but what is wrong with your internet see it has still not loaded all those screens. Which part of the world you live in man are you in Lucknow or some outer somewhere? bhai main Lucknow mein hi hu par mere chart mein aise planets hai ki I'll always have network connection throughout my life. Are ek chart ko na roll karke apni are kya karu main main city mein rehta hu to socho jo ye aashiyana wala center hai mere ghar se sirf 1.5 km dur hai. hmm. very nice. To are I think it's working yaar setting mein kuch hoga fault to main yaha pe hi private kar deta hu na. only those invited likha hua hai to but anyone in Granola dekh listen can access udhar jaa uh only those who invited mein hai na yaha to no no but upar hai na listen people can view save kar usko kaha pe likha hai listen people can access uh anyone in Granola mein jaa five people right dekh see listen being listen can access to ye to aap by default rahega hi na nahi nahi I can change that acha to matlab main iske bahar jaau pehle nahi nahi nahi wahi wahi wahi jaana hai we don't have to go anywhere only those invited pe jaa ek aur problem hai that you become the owner of this only those invited viewers can come on na save but usse to kuch nahi hoga. This settings won't apply to the one person directly invited or the members of Granola who currently have access. theek hai let's go right now we'll see but here the ek kaam karte hai na listen ke bahar bana lete hai na haa sari sari functionality to rahegi apne paas paid model mein I don't know kya issue hota hai unpaid mein wo free ho jayega na phir you'll switch to free free tier haa nahi rehne that's fine.
