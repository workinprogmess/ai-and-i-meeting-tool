@me: the recording still happened after three seconds. But, side bar, after three seconds, I remember the recording I just started three seconds later, but that's fine. Um, at least this recording, I can see the timer is on, the sound bar is on, though there was a three seconds, yeah. Um, it's even through my AirPods. Now I'm going to go and play a YouTube video about this guy talking about how I make apps feel ten times better, some design secrets.

@speaker1: One thing I want to point out too is that a lot of this stuff is actually not as hard as you might think. The cool part is I actually just vibe coded this completely with Claude code. I didn't write a single line of code for this. I'll give you a tip when it comes to complex interactions like this. Don't try to one-shot this and say, hey, can you go animate this for me? Because it's not going to come up with anything this cool and complex. For this one, I had to break down all the sub-animations that I wanted to happen. Can you make the arrow rotate into the check mark? Can you have that background expand from the microphone? Can you add some of this fade in fade out for the text? So I broke down all the components I wanted to happen in the interaction, and it just executed it for me flawlessly. Apple has a really good built-in API for animations, and Claude code and a lot of AI coding tools are very well trained on it. So you can actually just tell it to do this stuff for you in plain English, and it has a really high chance of doing it. But again, the trick is to not one-shot it and to instead break it down into steps.

@speaker1: Tip number two is

@speaker1: custom illustrations, especially for things like empty states. So this is when your app has no data in it, and it's just kind of an empty screen. A lot of apps just have a text that says there's no tasks for today or something like that. We want to go a step beyond that, add custom illustrations or even animations to those empty states. This is something you can actually do with the AI tools on the market. So in my case, for my app Lily, which is a meeting assistant app, I have this ghost mascot. What's really cool with AI tools like ChatGPT, you can actually take a base mascot like Lily, feed it into ChatGPT, and with the right prompts, you can actually generate almost an infinite amount of variations of this mascot. I actually used it to generate the empty state for the search page. So instead of it just saying there's no meetings here, instead there's this illustration of Lily the ghost searching for tasks. Or if there's an active meeting going on, I can have a custom illustration of Lily taking notes or sleeping or drinking coffee or walking my dog Luna. AI has really opened the door to make infinite illustrations, and it does add a ton of personality and really makes your app stand out. My recommendation is to try to find some sort of artist or illustrator to make you a base illustration if you can. In my case, I just asked my girlfriend

@me: Okay, now I'm going to take my AirPods off. Hey, hey, hey. Please record that. AirPods off. All right. Default microphone is in. Great. Which means we're recording this. And I'm happy to see this, but I will be even more happier when I see my audio shows up as I'm speaking and at the same time Google transcribes this. And hopefully in the very order around this time, like one point, you know, half a minute, like one and a half minutes and onwards. So now I'm going to go back and play a YouTube video again, this time without AirPods.
