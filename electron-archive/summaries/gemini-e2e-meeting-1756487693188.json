perhaps. but i think this is going to require a change at how models are built and optimized. software engineering requires models that can do more than just generate code.\"\n(forward-looking perspective, acknowledging the need for model evolution)\n\n[5:30-7:00]  detailed analysis of current LLM limitations üîµüü†\n\nspeaker dives deeper into the context switching and recency bias problems impacting LLMs.\n\n[5:45] @v: \"we know that current generative models suffer from several issues that directly impact their ability to maintain a coherent mental model: context omission, models are bad at finding omitted context, recency bias, there are very strong recency biases in the context window. they use and include completely contextual details that should not be there.\"\n(detailed explanation of technical limitations)\n\n\n[7:00-7:45]  mitigation strategies & closing thoughts üü¢\n\nspeaker discusses potential solutions, highlighting the need for human oversight, and concludes with a hopeful vision of human-AI collaboration.\n\n\n[7:15] @v:  \"these are hopefully not insurmountable problems... work is being done... to let them perform similar mental tricks to us. unfortunately, for now, they can't go beyond certain complexity and understand what is going on. they can't build software because they can't maintain these similar mental models and identify the differences and fix the code or the requirements.\"\n(summary of the limitations and the ongoing work to address them)\n\n[7:30] @v: \"for some tasks this is enough. for some tasks this is enough, the requirements are clear enough, the problems are simple enough that they can one-shot the whole thing. but not trivial. they're not capable of maintaining enough context accurately enough to iterate to a working solution. yet, the software engineers are responsible for ensuring that the requirements are clear and the code actually does what it proposes to do. and then we believe in a world where programmers and reasons can collaborate together to build better software. but for now we formally believe that at least for now your AI is just another tool to reach out for.\"\n(summarizing the current capabilities and the vision for the future)\n\n\n[7:45-end]  loose ends & future exploration üîµ\n\nspeaker briefly mentions \"zed\" (unclear what this refers to) and briefly touches on next generation code editors.\n\n[7:50] @v: \"zed?

This reveals a mix of optimism for the future and realistic acknowledgement of existing challenges.

The mood was one of focused curiosity tempered with realistic concern about LLM limitations. @v analyzed  the capabilities of LLMs in _code generation and modification_, contrasting them with the approaches of skilled human software engineers.  They highlighted the significant challenge of LLMs maintaining accurate _mental models_ of a project, and underscored the problems of _context omission_ and _recency bias_.  @v identified these as obstacles hindering LLMs' ability to iteratively build robust and functional software solutions.  While acknowledging the current limitations, @v expressed optimism towards future improvements.  They envisioned a world of successful human-AI collaboration in software engineering, where LLMs would become valuable tools, but with the understanding that human oversight and intervention will remain essential for complex projects. The session concluded with a brief, inconclusive discussion of a tool or concept called \"zed,\" and a quick look at next-generation code editors. The key takeaway is the urgent need to improve LLM's ability to retain and manage contextual information.\n\n\n### part 5: advanced insights\n\n**the one key thing:** LLMs currently lack the ability to maintain accurate mental models of complex projects; this fundamentally limits their usefulness in genuine software engineering.\n\n**unresolved questions:** What is \"zed\"?  How can recency bias and context omission in LLMs be effectively mitigated?\n\n**memorable moments:** The vivid description of how LLMs react to test failures (deleting all work and starting over) versus the methodical approach of human engineers.\n\n**specific action items:** There are no concrete action items as this was a personal reflection; however, the analysis suggests a need for focused research and development to enhance LLMs' capacity for context management and maintaining accurate mental models.\n",
