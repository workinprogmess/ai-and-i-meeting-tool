becomes easier ki let's say yaha par main tere se baat kar raha hu aur idhar for instance mera slack khula hai ya if i'm reading something ya if i'm doing something ya mera koi aur cheez khuli hai let's say ray wali chat khuli hai so it just makes it easy for you to move from one to another uh\"\n(explaining advantages, building a case for improved workflow)\n\n[4:45] @speaker2: \"toh yeh jyada

ek window yaha khuli hai much easier for me to\"\n(further contextualizing, explaining the advantage)\n\n[5:15] @speaker2: \"i think personal work ke liye better hai par office mein yeh distraction

at the same time in two different profiles\"\n(detailed explanation of the functionality)\n\n[6:15] @speaker2: \"toh samajh raha hu main kya keh raha hu\"\n(confirmation of understanding)\n\n\n[6:20]

@speaker1: \"okay but anyways iski toh bahut formatting honi hai abhi isi liye toh main bol raha hu na this is only for me test version hai yeh abhi yeh basic jo tune yeh dhancha tereko dikh raha hai minimal sa it's because i wanted to focus less on design and more on functionality but jaise jaise meri functionality thodi si stable ho rahi hai toh i need to work on design\"\n(explaining prioritization, showing rationale and a logical workflow)\n\n[6:40] @speaker2: \"yeh hindi ko bhi lelena hai\"\n(raising a new point, slightly concerned)\n\n[6:45] @speaker1: \"yes jaise ki main dikhaata hu yeh kuch abhi maine hamari wali bhi ek do kari hai i think chat gpt aur jeman dono hindi mein bhi kaafi comfortable hai yeah jaise yeh dekh ismein dekh mujhe lag raha hai ki\"\n(affirming and explaining, providing reassurance and showing examples)\n\n[6:50] @speaker1: \"play wale main thoda i like this play wale ko connect karta hu is isse baad card pe tap karo toh woh play wala\"\n(explaining a design element, using simple language)\n\n[6:55] @speaker1: \"abhi 16 16 hai upar se jo tune bola hoga 16 16 thoda sa is card ko bada kar do so that 48 ko bhi card ko bhi sabko thodi thodi space mil jaye\"\n(providing specific design feedback, making the request simple and clear)\n\n[7:00] @speaker2: \"kaafi precise hai\"\n(positive feedback, showing

that's kind of thing use name mein woh aap shuruat mein at the rate yeah at the rate username aayega yaha par like kuch meetings mein dikha deta hai usmein phir thoda sa ek buggy hai kuch meetings mein dikhayi jaise yeh at the rate v aa raha hai but yeh\"\n(highlighting a bug and its intermittent appearance)\n\n[7:10] @speaker2: \"selling kaise hoga\"\n(asking a question about future plans)\n\n[7:15] @speaker1: \"uh selling toh jyada difficult uh nahin hai i mean like pehle toh mereko uh selling se pehle na mujhe product ko thoda sa sahi karna hai in the sense like matlab like bigger selling pehle so right now what i'm doing is i'm gonna matlab yeh thoda sa is weekend tak stabilize ho jana chahiye mujhe lagta hai toh what i want to do is i will reach out to 10 20 founders on twitter jo may be granola use karte hain ya meeting app use karte hain jinkr baare mein baat karte hi rahte hain log anyway\"\n(explaining the selling strategy, conveying a logical workflow)\n\n[8:00-9:00] @speaker1 details his _go-to-market strategy_ focusing on _early adopters_. ðŸ”µ\ndiscussing his plan, focusing on acquiring a small number of loyal users first.\n\n[8:00] @speaker1: \"toh i'll just ping them aur jo ek do founders let's say do char panch founders se main thoda touch mein hu so i'm gonna just ask them ki hey i'm building this uh give this a try uh and obviously some will say no i'm good with this i don't this is not my problem etc that's fine so basically kuch reach out karke i will try ki mere pass 10 15 mere beta users ho jaye who who think jo main problem solve karne ka try kar raha hu with different kind of summaries human summaries and making meetings a little bit more human in the sense and more connected uh toh woh unki bhi problem ho\"\n(detailing the strategy, showing understanding of market dynamics)\n\n[8:10] @speaker1: \"jo ki maine search kiya hai there is a lot of people who feel that meeting notes are bland kuch toh milta nahi hai unse aadi cheezein yeah feel toh aati nahin hai usmein toh toh feel lane ke liye aap uh basically some people are thinking about this is a problem so i'll see like if people would relate yes i think easy to find those people and then you know like just uh sort of uh learn from their feedback may be ek hafta do hafta unke sath kaam kar ke to see like what the idea is that those 10 15 people actually become mad loyalist like they feel like man this is the product this this this really solves my problem\"\n(providing additional context, explaining strategy)\n\n\n[9:00-10:00] @speaker1 discusses _scaling_ and _investor needs_. ðŸŸ \nfocus shifts to long-term plans, showing slight concern and cautious optimism.\n\n[9:00] @speaker1: \"so if because if that happens then those 10 15 people would bring another 10 15 people or 20 people or whatever that is and if they also like it and if they really like it then those 20 people will bring another 20 30 40 people and ek do unme se koi influencer hoga kisi ki jyada following hogi kuch hoga jo thoda sa jyada impact create karega so i don't want like rush like quickly mere pass 100 users aa jaye because usse aap learn nahin kar pate and it's very important to have people who are mad about your product at least the first hundred people should be really really crazy about your product before you really go to more and more people otherwise imagine you have like 500 users may be woh aapko pay kar rahe hain but they are like average uh they are not in love with your product they will lose they will they will give up and they will not talk about it they will not go gaga about your product on twitter jaise log granola ke baare mein notion ke baare mein ya you know like aajkal ki kuch kuch cheezein jo nahin aa rahi hain product jaise abhi aajkal yeh google ka jo image product aaya hai\"\n(explaining the importance of building a loyal base, showing understanding of market dynamics)\n\n[9:10] @speaker1: \"so so so how do you how do you do that that is the most important thing agar woh ho gaya na like first 30 40 50 60 people who are so in love by from there going to 3000 is much easier first 300 and then 3000 so toh aapko toh investor ki jarurat hi nahin padegi\"\n(reiterating the key point, answering the previous question)\n\n[9:15] @speaker1: \"i think so i'm not really thinking about investors at least right now i think it should be a very very profitable business probably like 80% gross margin pe operate karna chahiye main may be let's say agar thoda sa kuch power users honge woh jyada use karenge toh may be like 50 60% toh agar main jitna paisa kama raha hu usse main shayad aadha paisa kharch kar raha hu so that that should be the math ultimately should come out toh ideally should not be but uh scale karna hota hai aapko toh toh but i'm not thinking about scale right now i just want\"\n(explaining financial projections, emphasizing profitability and organic growth)\n\n[9:25] @speaker2: \"scale karne mein kya issue hai aapko bas cloud space chahiye hoga woh toh phir aap aa hi sakte hain na\"\n(raising a question about scaling, identifying a key challenge)\n\n[9:30] @speaker1: \"nahi yaar i mean like actually it's not just that matlab woh phir alag level ki problem aati hai when you are thinking about 100000 users one million users it requires marketing not just because organic se aap ek level tak hi pahunch pate ho organic ka jo growth rate bhi hota hai woh bhi thoda sa slow hota hai but i can burn money i can spend on influencer marketing i can spend on all kinds of other form of marketing to have more and more people using my product i can work on all kind of other strategies going on podcasts doing this putting down granola saying my product is so much better then invest in my own podcast matlab all kinds of growth growth tactics aap karte ho then product ko bhi aap phir us level ka enhance karte ho enterprise ke liye bhi ready karte ho ki bilkul enterprise mein main jau ek contract se hi mujhe seedha 100000 dollar mil jaye toh phir aap us point of view se bhi product ko ready karte ho ab product ko ready karne ke liye phir aapko team chahiye aur enterprise sales karne ke liye sales team chahiye toh when you start thinking about all those things then you know\"\n(explaining the complexity of scaling, outlining the marketing and team building requirements)\n\n[9:40] @speaker2: \"i think retirement plan ke liye thoda chhota base 1000 do 3000\"\n(raising a concern, expressing a different viewpoint)\n\n[9:45] @speaker1: \"oh yeah see think about it think about it thoda chhota toh think about that that's what i'm thinking about right now imagine i have 1000 paying users toh sochke dekh ek baari ke liye and i'm not even thinking really big 1000 paying users achievable number in the next whatever time six months one year whatever now 1000 paying users let's say if i charge 25 dollars a month which is the lowest in this category that's 25000 dollars a month jis mein se maan le agar main jis mein se maan le agar main 10000 dollar kharch bhi kar raha hu har mahine ke i still am making like 15000 dollars abhi main thoda mota mota math bata raha hu\"\n(explaining financial projections, emphasizing profitability)\n\n\n[10:00-11:00]  @speaker1 clarifies his _long-term goals_ and _reason for moving to the US_.

\"yaar woh mujhe isliye nahin jaana hai ki kyunki main paise nahin kama sakta paise toh main kama sakta hu woh mujhe isliye jaana hai kyunki mujhe sikhna hai i want to be friends with sam altman i want to be friends with all those investors right because they are operating at a very different level the picture jo duniya ki picture woh dekh rahe hain aur jo main dekh raha hu\"\n(clarifying his motivations, expressing a personal goal)\n\n[10:10] @speaker2: \"matlab aapka divorce na kara de\"\n(expressing a light-hearted concern)\n\n[10:15] @speaker1: \"kyun karayega yaar woh toh badhiya banda hai\"\n(responding to the concern, showing confidence)\n\n[10:20] @speaker1: \"what i mean is like woh is a very different problem jiske liye main waha jaana chahta hu paise toh main yaha baitha

is the this is basically the thing right now abhi yaha par meetings hai yeh summary yeh transcript hai yeh summary hai bahut bahut basic formatting hai obviously isko neat karna hai sab kuch karna hai is window ko thoda sa banana hai abhi koi sign in nahi hai koi kuch nahi hai toh woh lekar aana hai uh koi settings nahi hai woh lekar aana hai toh basically wahi cheez hai toh granola se na tereko kya cheez dekhni hai because woh finished product hai it works right i'm not worried about woh summary kaise karta hai because uske liye woh mera wahi toh differentiation hai\"\n(explaining the current state, focusing on the core aspects)\n\n[11:10] @speaker2: \"koi aur meri summary hai\"\n(raising a question about the summarization method)\n\n[11:15] @speaker1: \"haan flow dekhna hai ui dekhna hai aesthetics dekhna hai uh uh kaha par kya hai kitna spacing kitna woh tujhe bass usko bahut ache se understand aur study karna hai so that hum kuch kuch cheezein yaha le lein so mujhe na kya karna hai ki mereko interface ko reinvent nahin karna hai right mujhe product ki quality improve karni hai jo aapko mil raha hai which is meeting notes\"\n(explaining what to focus on in terms of

competitor)\n\n[11:25] @speaker1: \"yaar it's not about granola wale kyun nahin kar pa rahe hain it's about obviously they can also do it because it's a prompt main bhi prompt kar raha hu woh bhi ai ko prompt kar rahe hain dono kar sakte hain but it's about ki aap konsi problem solve kar rahe ho they are fine they are fine not doing it otter bhi nahin kar raha otter toh granola se bhi bahut badi company hai otter ne toh 100 million dollar raise kare hue hai\"\n(explaining the reasons, showcasing strong reasoning and differentiation)\n\n\n[12:00-13:00] @speaker1 uses _Google Docs_ and _Notion_

dekhna na matlab it's like feature se bhara pada itna messy itna potty product hai but see this is the thing you have to understand that like for instance google docs tha right google docs tha google docs abhi bhi hai but then notion aaya notion ne kaha ki main document likhna aur banane ko itna simple itna aasan aur itna creative aur itna beautiful kar dunga that it will be like makhan at the same time google docs mein document ko manage karna like ek page idhar ek page idhar ek page unhone nested bana diya ki page ke andar hi page ke andar hi page ke andar hi page is like ek jagah par cheezein automatically organized hone lag jaye at the same time it's so very easy and convenient to design to to to use a doc or something ab google docs bhi kar sakta tha unke pass paise hain engineers hain sab hain but it's about what is the frame of reference you are going with what problem you are solving is this your focus area is this or not that is why startups disrupt badi companies\"\n(explanation of his vision, putting it in the right context)\n\n[12:15] @speaker1: \"slack aaya itne saare products the phir bhi slack aaya became such a big company and now slack has become a incumbent ki people are now disrupting with ai they are building their own newer version of slack with ai at the core toh that is that is the beauty of the technology right you can take a problem solve it so very well that may be you can challenge a bigger company that's the beauty so it's not about they can't do it problem basically ab ek tarike se problem solve ho rahi hai convenience jyada provide kiya ja raha hai yes bilkul sahi baat hai toh it's just about that but anyway meri problem i honestly not thinking about jaise main tereko bol raha hu i don't want to replace granola or anything please become big company i just want a small niche i just want to serve thousand two thousand users and i'm fine with that\"\n(explanation of his vision and market strategy,

vision.\n\n[12:30] @speaker1: \"aur phir pata hai ek aur cheez abhi matlab the beauty about these things is application maan le maine ek chhoti si audience ke liye bana diya which is founders now the same product because humanness aur jo main cross meeting analysis bol raha hu ki ek meeting note aur dusri meeting note mein jo relationship hai woh abhi pata hi nahin lagta ek meeting note yaha pada hai dusra meeting note yaha pada hai dono mein koi relationship hi nahin dikhta hai but jab tu aur main baat karte hain hum ek design ke upar kitni meetings lete hain unse nikal ke kitni cheezein aati hain hume design ko kaise samjhna hai kaise dekhna hai kaise kya karna hai hamare to do's kya hain right but hamari meetings baat hi nahin karti hai na granola pe na kisi aur pe ab agar main yeh wali jo aspect hai yeh main therapist ki life pe apply kar du jo ek bacche ke sath ya ek ek ek adult ke sath series of meetings leta hai aur socho us adult ke insights ek sath banne lag jaye toh woh therapist ko kitna help karenge toh if you try to start applying those to different markets let's say from founders to therapist to coaches to sales people or whatever that is then you also further your market grows but again you don't have to like target every therapist again another 500 therapists another 10 lakh rupees another 500 coaches another 10 lakh so those kind of things you can do but all those are dreams but you first have to make it work for 50 people you have to really really win in fact 50 se pehle the first 10 people they have to really love your product that's the thing\"\n(explaining the potential for expansion, conveying optimism and a vision for the future)\n\n[13:00] @speaker2: \"toh mujhe notion kyun dekhna hai\"\n(raising question again)\n\n[13:05] @speaker1: \"notion isliye bhi dekhna hai because notion is a document app and this is also a document app and notion has really nailed documents though abhi notion bhi thoda sa cumbersome ho gaya hai and notion also does meeting notes now\"\n(explaining the comparison, showing strong reasoning)\n\n[13:10] @speaker2: \"main honestly na main kabhi notion ke sath itna comfortable ho hi nahin paya\"\n(expressing a personal opinion)\n\n[13:15] @speaker1: \"thik hai toh tu notion mat dekhna just check granola ek product ko ache se uski saari screens dekh lena lekin nahi nahi main notion dekh lunga par aise hi bata raha hu ki notion ka learning toh pata nahin matlab notion ki basic cheez toh main kar leta hu par jo uska jo complex database wala part hai na haan usmein toh mereko koi samajh hi nahin aata ki shuru kaha se kare\"\n(responding to concerns, offering alternatives)\n\n\n[13:20] @speaker1: \"thik hai but notion database is not the problem that we have to solve for this product because we are not doing databases in this product right toh notion only from a standpoint of again sidebar sidebar kis tarah se arranged hai unki document document ki hierarchy kya hai kya kya cheezein aap kar sakte ho if a long document kis tarah se woh organize hota hai even document ko bhi uh thoda sa uh uski bhi alag settings hai ki aap yeh wala font use kar sakte ho yeh wala kar sakte

@speaker1: \"okay but anyways iski toh bahut formatting honi hai abhi isi liye toh main bol raha hu na this is only for me test version hai yeh abhi yeh basic jo tune yeh dhancha tereko dikh raha hai minimal sa it's because i wanted to focus less on design and more on functionality but jaise jaise meri functionality thodi si stable ho rahi hai toh i need to work on design\"\n(explaining

plans)\n\n[7:15] @speaker1: \"uh selling toh jyada difficult uh nahin hai i mean like pehle toh mereko uh selling se pehle na mujhe product ko thoda sa sahi karna hai in the sense like matlab like bigger selling pehle so right now what i'm doing is i'm gonna matlab yeh thoda sa is weekend tak stabilize ho jana chahiye mujhe lagta hai toh what i want to do is i will reach out to 10 20 founders on twitter jo may be granola use karte hain ya meeting app use karte hain jinkr baare mein baat karte hi rahte hain log anyway\"\n(explaining the selling strategy, conveying a logical

@speaker1: \"toh i'll just ping them aur jo ek do founders let's say do char panch founders se main thoda touch mein hu so i'm gonna just ask them ki hey i'm building this uh give this a try uh and obviously some will say no i'm good with this i don't this is not my problem etc that's fine so basically kuch reach out karke i will try ki mere pass 10 15 mere beta users ho jaye who who think jo main problem solve karne ka try kar raha hu with different kind of summaries human summaries and making meetings a little bit more human in the sense and more connected uh toh woh unki bhi problem ho\"\n(detailing the strategy, showing understanding of market dynamics)\n\n[8:10] @speaker1: \"jo ki maine search kiya hai there is a lot of people who feel that meeting notes are bland kuch toh milta nahi hai unse aadi cheezein yeah feel toh aati nahin hai usmein toh toh feel lane ke liye aap uh basically some people are thinking about this is a problem so i'll see like if people would relate yes i think easy to find those people and then you know like just uh sort of uh learn from their feedback may be ek hafta do hafta unke sath kaam kar ke to see like what the idea is that those 10 15 people actually become mad loyalist like they feel like man this is the product this this this really solves my problem\"\n(providing additional context, explaining strategy)\n\n\n[9:00-10:00] @speaker1 discusses _scaling_ and _investor needs_. ðŸŸ \nfocus shifts to long-term plans, showing slight concern and cautious optimism.\n\n[9:00] @speaker1: \"so if because if that happens then those 10 15 people would bring another 10 15 people or 20 people or whatever that is and if they also like it and if they really like it then those 20 people will bring another 20 30 40 people and ek do unme se koi influencer hoga kisi ki jyada following hogi kuch hoga jo thoda sa jyada impact create karega so i don't want like rush like quickly mere pass 100 users aa jaye because usse aap learn nahin kar pate and it's very important to have people who are mad about your product at least the first hundred people should be really really crazy about your product before you really go to more and more people otherwise imagine you have like 500 users may be woh aapko pay kar rahe hain but they are like average uh they are not in love with your product they will lose they will they will give up and they will not talk about it they will not go gaga about your product on twitter jaise log granola ke baare mein notion ke baare mein ya you know like aajkal ki kuch kuch cheezein jo nahin aa rahi hain product jaise abhi aajkal yeh google ka jo image product aaya hai\"\n(explaining the importance of building a loyal base, showing understanding of market dynamics)\n\n[9:10] @speaker1: \"so so so how do you how do you do that that is the most important thing agar woh ho gaya na like first 30 40 50 60 people who are so in love by from there going to 3000 is much easier first 300 and then 3000 so toh aapko toh investor ki jarurat hi nahin padegi\"\n(reiterating the key point, answering the previous question)\n\n[9:15] @speaker1: \"i think so i'm not really thinking about investors at least right now i think it should be a very very profitable business probably like 80% gross margin pe operate karna chahiye main may be let's say agar thoda sa kuch power users honge woh jyada use karenge toh may be like 50 60% toh agar main jitna paisa kama raha hu usse main shayad aadha paisa kharch kar raha hu so that that should be the math ultimately should come out toh ideally should not be but uh scale karna hota hai aapko toh toh but i'm not thinking about scale right now i just want\"\n(explaining financial projections, emphasizing profitability and organic growth)\n\n[9:25] @speaker2: \"scale karne mein kya issue hai aapko bas cloud space chahiye hoga woh toh phir aap aa hi sakte hain na\"\n(raising a question about scaling, identifying a key challenge)\n\n[9:30] @speaker1: \"nahi yaar i mean like actually it's not just that matlab woh phir alag level ki problem aati hai when you are thinking about 100000 users one million users it requires marketing not just because organic se aap ek level tak hi pahunch pate ho organic ka jo growth rate bhi hota hai woh bhi thoda sa slow hota hai but i can burn money i can spend on influencer marketing i can spend on all kinds of other form of marketing to have more and more people using my product i can work on all kind of other strategies going on podcasts doing this putting down granola saying my product is so much better then invest in my own podcast matlab all kinds of growth growth tactics aap karte ho then product ko bhi aap phir us level ka enhance karte ho enterprise ke liye bhi ready karte ho ki bilkul enterprise mein main jau ek contract se hi mujhe seedha 100000 dollar mil jaye toh phir aap us point of view se bhi product ko ready karte ho ab product ko ready karne ke liye phir aapko team chahiye aur enterprise sales karne ke liye sales team chahiye toh when you start thinking about all those things then you know\"\n(explaining the complexity of scaling, outlining the marketing and team building requirements)\n\n[9:40] @speaker2: \"i think retirement plan ke liye thoda chhota base 1000 do 3000\"\n(raising a concern, expressing a different viewpoint)\n\n[9:45] @speaker1: \"oh yeah see think about it think about it thoda chhota toh think about that that's what i'm thinking about right now imagine i have 1000 paying users toh sochke dekh ek baari ke liye and i'm not even thinking really big 1000 paying users achievable number in the next whatever time six months one year whatever now 1000 paying users let's say if i charge 25 dollars a month which is the lowest in this category that's 25000 dollars a month jis mein se maan le agar main jis mein se maan le agar main 10000 dollar kharch bhi kar raha hu har mahine ke i still am making like 15000 dollars abhi main thoda mota

is the this is basically the thing right now abhi yaha par meetings hai yeh summary yeh transcript hai yeh summary hai bahut bahut basic formatting hai obviously isko neat karna hai sab kuch karna hai is window ko thoda sa banana hai abhi koi sign in nahi hai koi kuch nahi hai toh woh lekar aana hai uh koi settings nahi hai woh lekar aana hai toh basically wahi cheez hai toh granola se na tereko kya cheez dekhni hai because woh finished product hai it works right i'm not worried about woh summary kaise karta hai because uske liye woh mera wahi toh differentiation hai\"\n(explaining the

company hai otter ne toh 100 million dollar raise kare hue hai\"\n(explaining the reasons, showcasing strong reasoning and differentiation)\n\n\n[12:00-13:00] @speaker1 uses _Google Docs_ and _Notion_ as examples to explain his _product vision_. ðŸŸ¢\ndetailed example used to explain the unique positioning of the application; resolution achieved.\n\n[12:00] @speaker1: \"otter toh shittiest product dekhna na matlab it's like feature se bhara pada itna messy itna potty product hai but see this is the thing you have to understand that like for instance google docs tha right google docs tha google docs abhi bhi hai but then notion aaya notion ne kaha ki main document likhna aur banane ko itna simple itna aasan aur itna creative aur itna beautiful kar dunga that it will be like makhan at the same time google docs mein document ko manage karna like ek page idhar ek page idhar ek page unhone nested bana diya ki page ke andar hi page ke andar hi page ke andar hi page is like ek jagah par cheezein automatically organized hone lag jaye at the same time it's so very easy and convenient to design to to to use a doc or something ab google docs bhi kar sakta tha unke pass paise hain engineers hain sab hain but it's about what is the frame of reference you are going with what problem you are solving is this your focus area is this or not that is why startups disrupt badi companies\"\n(explanation of his vision, putting it in the right context)\n\n[12:15] @speaker1: \"slack aaya itne saare products the phir bhi slack aaya became such a big company and now slack has become a incumbent ki people are now disrupting with ai they are building their own newer version of slack with ai at the core toh that is that is the beauty of the technology right you can take a problem solve it so very well that may be you can challenge a bigger company that's the beauty so it's not about they can't do it problem basically ab ek tarike se problem solve ho rahi hai convenience jyada provide kiya ja raha hai yes bilkul sahi baat hai toh it's just about that but anyway meri problem i honestly not thinking about jaise main tereko bol raha hu i don't want to replace granola or anything please become big company i just want a small niche i just want to serve thousand two thousand users and i'm fine with that\"\n(explanation of his vision and market strategy, emphasizing long-term view)\n\n\n[12:30-13:30]  @speaker1 discusses _future expansion_ into other markets. ðŸŸ¡\nshifts focus to future expansion, expressing optimism and excitement about his vision.\n\n[12:30] @speaker1: \"aur phir pata hai ek aur cheez abhi matlab the beauty about these things is application maan le maine ek chhoti si audience ke liye bana diya which is founders now the same product because humanness aur jo main cross meeting analysis bol raha hu ki ek meeting note aur dusri meeting note mein jo relationship hai woh abhi pata hi nahin lagta ek meeting note yaha pada hai dusra meeting note yaha pada hai dono mein koi relationship hi nahin dikhta hai but jab tu aur main baat karte hain hum ek design ke upar kitni meetings lete hain unse nikal ke kitni cheezein aati hain hume design ko kaise samjhna hai kaise dekhna hai kaise kya karna hai hamare to do's kya hain right but hamari meetings baat hi nahin karti hai na granola pe na kisi aur pe ab agar main yeh wali jo aspect hai yeh main therapist ki life pe apply kar du jo ek bacche ke sath ya ek ek ek adult ke sath series of meetings leta hai aur socho us adult ke insights ek sath banne lag jaye toh woh therapist ko kitna help karenge toh if you try to start applying those to different markets let's say from founders to therapist to coaches to sales people or whatever that is then you also further your market grows but again you don't have to like target every therapist again another 500 therapists another 10 lakh rupees another 500 coaches another 10 lakh so those kind of things you can do but all those are dreams but you first have to make it work for 50 people you have to really really win in fact 50 se pehle the first 10 people they have to really love your product that's the thing\"\n(explaining the potential for expansion, conveying optimism and a vision for the future)\n\n[13:00] @speaker2: \"toh mujhe notion kyun dekhna hai\"\n(raising question again)\n\n[13:05] @speaker1: \"notion isliye bhi dekhna hai because notion is a document app and this is also a document app and notion has really nailed documents though abhi notion bhi thoda sa cumbersome ho gaya hai and notion also does meeting notes now\"\n(explaining the comparison, showing strong reasoning)\n\n[13:10] @speaker2: \"main honestly na main kabhi notion ke sath itna comfortable ho hi nahin paya\"\n(expressing a personal opinion)\n\n[13:15] @speaker1: \"thik hai toh tu notion mat dekhna just check granola ek product ko ache se uski saari screens dekh lena lekin nahi nahi main notion dekh lunga par aise hi bata raha hu ki notion ka learning toh pata nahin matlab notion ki basic cheez toh main kar leta hu par jo uska jo complex database wala part hai na haan usmein toh mereko koi samajh hi nahin aata ki shuru kaha se kare\"\n(responding to concerns, offering alternatives)\n\n\n[13:20] @speaker1: \"thik hai but notion database is not the problem that we have to solve for this product because we are not doing databases in this product right toh notion only from a standpoint of again sidebar sidebar kis tarah se arranged hai unki document document ki hierarchy kya hai kya kya cheezein aap kar sakte ho if a long document kis tarah se woh organize hota hai even document ko bhi uh thoda sa uh uski bhi alag settings hai ki aap yeh wala font use kar sakte ho yeh wala kar sakte ho just just see like how and some of those things how it works because see design learning this kind of interface jo ki bahut simple hote hain na technically",
