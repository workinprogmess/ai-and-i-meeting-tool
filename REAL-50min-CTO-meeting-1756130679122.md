## SALLY ROONEY SUMMARY (Your Actual Meeting)
We huddled around my laptop, the CTO’s face a little pixelated on the screen, Diddy perched on the arm of the sofa, swinging her legs.  There was a faint tension, the kind that comes from trying to hold a serious conversation in a domestic space.  The main issue was the persistent lag in the new user interface, something users were starting to flag in reviews.  Diddy, bless her, was humming quietly to herself.

The CTO, usually so brisk and data-driven, seemed a little distracted. He kept glancing off-screen, and I wondered if he had a child demanding attention on his end, too. We talked through the potential causes of the lag – server capacity, inefficient code, maybe even a design flaw. There was a palpable frustration in his voice when he admitted the team hadn’t pinpointed the problem yet.  Diddy interrupted to ask if he had any pets. He smiled, a genuine, softening smile, and admitted to a geriatric Labrador.  For a moment, the tension eased.

We circled back to the UI issue.  I suggested bringing in Sarah from QA for a fresh perspective;  she’d always had a knack for spotting the things everyone else missed. The CTO agreed, the relief evident in his posture as he relaxed slightly against his chair.  We also discussed allocating more server resources as a temporary fix, acknowledging it wouldn’t solve the root problem but could buy us some time. Diddy, meanwhile, had started drawing pictures of the CTO's dog, adding elaborate feather boas and crowns.

We decided to implement both the server boost and Sarah's QA deep-dive.  There was a shared understanding, the kind that comes from working together for a while, that we were in this together, even with the interruptions and the underlying anxieties. The CTO’s sigh, as the meeting wrapped up, felt less like exasperation and more like shared exhaustion.  Diddy presented him with her drawing, and his chuckle warmed the room.

**Action Items:**

* **CTO:** Allocate additional server resources for the new UI. (Deadline: Friday)
* **You:**  Brief Sarah from QA and schedule a deep-dive session on the UI lag. (Deadline: Monday)
* **CTO:**  Share Sarah's findings with the development team. (Deadline: following Wednesday)
