@me: uh no no no consult that is a that is a session card. 
@me: जहां पर that is a session card like do you have a session right now?
@me: right this is a child this is a child card.
@me: the difference between session card is that focuses on this session and it does not care about what other details a child has or where does a child stand in the overall journey. This is a child card. It needs to capture all those details about the child because we don't have a child profile.
@me: for the time being main to soch raha hu that which can actually remove this as well.
@me: we don't need it.
@me: can keep it but we don't need it.
@me: ha but I think um but the only problem is that if we don't have this then we only have two tabs. That's not that doesn't look good.
@me: uh we don't also have any other tab.
@speaker1: inside hain na do file main
@speaker1: kuchh khas hai nahin yaar do matlab
@me: but what we can do is we can make uh a tab three so there is there is today and then there is profile and then there is the third tab which is um weekly nahin nahin yaar kuchh bhi UIs thodi karenge.
@speaker1: obvious nahin hai
@me: um
@me: main task uh ek important cheez hai nahin nahin but wo wo alag tab doesn't make sense. But for the time being task can be alag tab right instead of this tab.
@speaker1: isko humne but unhone na hirar unhone na API change karna padega unko bilkul. Because right now they have structured it as there is there is this navigation and the task is a second tab inside this phase. They have to completely take that out from the backend and then put it as a separate tab which is I don't think we should do that and make that change. Let's keep it simple.
@speaker1: obviously aap back
@speaker1: ki even if like itna ki baat nahin hai even if like unko agar do ghante bhi usko laga ke karna hai like why why are we gonna put that effort and then you test which is like temporary because we'll always will never keep task separate. We'll then push it back in the next release.
@speaker1: so why why even do that?
@speaker1: nahin bhai aise kaam nahin karte is not everything is not web and HTML.  ki aapne link idhar kar diya ek kaam karo isko uthake
@me: we have made being app. We have made being app. I have had such conversations with Abhishek.
@me: right so I know ki main jab koi cheez idhar rakh deta hu aur uske baad uthake usko idhar leke aata hu then all the pushback that I receive from Abhishek.
@me: um so uh it's I wish it were a link uh but it's not. Anyways I think um like so I'm thinking two things. I mean like so so hum we do not change the existing structure. Let it be the way it's made. And then two things one keep chat with jo tech hai chat with tech wo main idhar le aau so that there is a separate tab for them to tell us any issues any concern any ek wo kar sakte hain ya fir main soch raha tha ki isme third tab mein hum apna ek doc page link kar denge which which will tell us like what's gonna come in the future. But that is like boring. Uh chat with tech le aate hain ek bari ke liye uh and that can open as a separate thing and they can tell us any issue whatsoever.
@speaker1: correct correct support basically tech support
@speaker1: ya usse yeah unko dikh raha hai temporarily first release mein I'm sure they'll have issues anyway to might do the job and we can avoid kids kids wala tab hum bad mein layenge.
@speaker1: theek hai let's do that.
@speaker2: naam kya du support du ya chat du?
@speaker1: support de deta hu
@speaker2: are to ab to isme kuchh aisa hai nahin na kyunki profile mein picture hai mission mein apna logo hai
@speaker2: kis mein kids mein support ka dhund raha hu lucid pe dhund raha hu ya to kahin aur dhundunga

@speaker2: to support mein koi google se image download kar lunga
@speaker2: ye laga du kya live agent wala nahin yaar bhai
@speaker2: aisa kuchh hath ka laga sakte hain
@speaker2: yaar jab tu aisi cheeze karta hai na mujhe lagta hai ki have you like have we not worked together for last nine ten months?
@speaker2: nahin bhai matlab koi bhi random cheez laake utha denge kya hum koi bhi
@speaker1: nahin random nahin main wo keh raha hu ki gesture laenge to illustration nahin
@speaker2: wo to theek hai but wo google ki image which has completely different language whatsoever style everything we just put anything
@speaker2: aisa kare kya ki koi hand matlab koi emoji use kar le uske color agar change kar paye to
