brief description of conversational or emotional shift

[timestamp] @person: "actual quote"
           (insight about this moment)

[topic shift] when conversation moves to different context


[0:00-0:30] @speaker1 is testing a new meeting recording feature. 🔵 focus
@speaker1 is carefully observing the functionality and user interface.

[0:00] @speaker1: "we're inside uh the okay we're inside this is gray. i can see the wave animation. i can see the timer it says recording and recording in progress. i can see the new meeting recording appeared in the sidebar. however the ui of this new part is not the same as the two other recordings previously. so maybe we'll have a look at that. that's okay."
(a methodical observation of a new feature; primarily focused and analytical)

[0:30-1:00] @speaker1 continues testing, noting a "stop recording" button. 🔵 focus
@speaker1 seems to be methodically working through the features.

[0:37] @speaker1: "okay so i see a stop recording bit as well. this is still just microphone speaking. let me play some youtube video and record record uh alright i'll record this i'll play around uh"
(testing the recording with audio from another source.  still methodical)

[1:00-1:45]  @speaker1 plays a youtube video, apparently about depression, and analyzes what's being said. 🔵 focus
the audio switches to a youtube video discussing different levels of awareness of depression

[1:00] @speaker1: "i am depressed versus this depression. those are different levels of identification. when i'm identifying with depression i am depressed. the other is i'm aware that there is depression and i am i'm in a state of depression but there is an awareness that is quite independent of that. in that awareness that spaciousness around performs is equanimity. i am depressed versus this depression." 
(a thoughtful analysis of a philosophical point within the youtube video)

[1:45-2:00] @speaker1 returns to testing the recording function. 🔵 focus
the focus shifts back to the technical aspects.

[1:45] @speaker1: "okay this has happened too i'm guessing it was recording still so far it seems it seems seamless. let me now stop recording we are at one minute thirty seven seconds"
(a confirmation that the recording is working, possibly seamlessly integrating the youtube video)
