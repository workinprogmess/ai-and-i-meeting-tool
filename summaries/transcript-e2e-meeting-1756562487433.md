[0:00-0:30] @you: testing microphone recording setup ðŸ”µ
_technical setup_ for recording a youtube video

[0:00] @you: "because my microphone recording starts and then apple has the default..."
(checking if the recording is working correctly)

[0:05] @you: "...hopefully. i'm guessing yeah. as that should work right. it should be seamless microphone through airpods..."
(expectation of seamless audio recording with airpods)


[0:15] @you: "...everything that i'm speaking word by word line by line should be there as simple as that. next i'm gonna play a youtube video..."
(detailing the plan to record a youtube video and the audio from it)


[0:30-1:30] @you: testing audio recording with a youtube video ðŸ”µ
_testing audio quality and multi-speaker identification_

[0:30] @you: "...and the system audio and through my airpods should also be captured again line by line word by word. this guy i think didi is still speaking i'm guessing so let's hear him speak..."
(checking how google transcribes the video audio with airpods on)

[1:00] @you:  "...and i hope google also identifies him as a separate speaker."
(hope for clear speaker differentiation in the transcription)

[1:30-2:00] @you: removing airpods and testing built-in microphone ðŸ”µ
_switching audio input from airpods to built-in microphone_

[1:30] @you: "okay so this is what i captured where didi talked about what menlo does... they're big investors in anthropic and i'm still speaking this part through my airpods. now i'm gonna take airpods off."
(checking if audio from the video and the speaker is captured)

[1:45] @you: "hopefully this line hopefully i switch seamlessly to built-in microphones this line is being said without airpods and i wanna see this line in the transcript i really really hope to see that."
(explicitly testing the microphone switch)

[2:00-2:30] @you: resuming youtube video playback and testing ðŸ”µ
_restarting the video and retesting the built-in microphone_

[2:00] @you: "at the same time now i'm gonna go back to the same video and let didi speak again about what they do maybe i'm gonna just forward it... didi still speaking? how about this guy? uh no, let's let's go back nikhil is speaking."
(experimenting with different parts of the video)

[2:30-3:00] @nikhil: discussing open door and real estate commissions ðŸŸ 
_commentary on open door and US real estate market_

[2:30] @you: "you tell us a bit about open door we were discussing earlier but it's interesting."
(prompting @nikhil on open door)

[2:31] @nikhil: "yeah it's it's in the news right now because it's become a meme stock that's like growing really well but um i still fundamentally believe in the mission so i think unlike other countries in the world where a transaction cost for buying or selling a home is 1% or lower in the us it's 6% which means when you're trying to sell a home agents take 6% of the commission and that's crazy residential real estate is the second largest asset class in this country and there's a 6% tax to doing that which is just..."
(insightful observation and criticism of US real estate commissions)

[2:59] @you: "okay okay so it should be good now."
(concluding the test)
