      "summary": "Opening\nIt was the three of them: the team lead, Sarah (designer), and Mike (developer), on a quick three‑minute check‑in about user onboarding. The tone was brisk and a little worried in a practical way—the team lead set it up as something to “figure out,” and there was an audible sigh once the problem clarified.\n\nKey discussion points\n- The drop‑off: Sarah surfaced the headline number—about 40% of users aren’t completing signup—and pointed to step 3 as the friction point. The verification email is confusing: people don’t see it, or don’t know what to do when they do. Mike, joining a bit late and apologetic about traffic, backed this up with support tickets from the past week asking where the email went.\n- The email itself: Sarah noted the current template “looks like spam,” which likely compounds the issue when users do find it. Mike said he could take on a redesign and would want to test multiple versions.\n- Guidance on the page: To address delivery and expectation‑setting, Sarah suggested clearer on‑page messaging—explicitly telling users to check their inbox and spam folder. The team lead asked for a same‑day mock.\n\nDecisions and agreements\nThey agreed the priority is step 3. Two tracks: improve the email experience (template redesign with A/B testing) and add clearer on‑page guidance around the verification email. Sarah will mock the page messaging today. Mike will deliver a redesigned email template and run A/B tests, aiming for Friday. The team closed quickly with no further topics.\n\nAction items\n- Sarah: Mock up on‑page messaging about the verification email (including a prompt to check spam) by end of day today.\n- Mike: Redesign the verification email template and set up A/B tests; target delivery by Friday.\n- Team lead: Follow up tomorrow, per the closing.",

      "summary": "The air felt thick with unspoken urgency as Sarah, the designer, Mike, the developer, and their team lead huddled (virtually, it seemed) to dissect the ailing user onboarding flow.  There was a palpable sense of shared responsibility for the 40% drop-off rate, a statistic that hung heavy in the brief silence before the discussion began.\n\nSarah, already immersed in the data, pinpointed the verification email in Step 3 as the likely culprit.  She articulated her concerns with a quiet certainty, suggesting users were either overlooking the email entirely or dismissing it as spam.  Mike, arriving late with a mumbled apology about traffic, immediately validated Sarah’s assessment, citing a surge in related support tickets.  There was a sense of relief, almost, in this shared understanding of the problem.\n\nThe team lead, perhaps sensing the shift in energy, quickly distilled the conversation into two actionable items: improving email deliverability and redesigning the email template itself.  Mike, with a practical efficiency, volunteered to tackle the redesign, estimating a two-day turnaround for A/B testing. Sarah, ever attentive to user experience, proposed adding clearer messaging on the signup page, prompting users to check their spam folders.  There was a quiet competence in the way they divided the labor, each seemingly comfortable in their respective roles.\n\nThe meeting concluded with a sense of cautious optimism.  While the problem remained, a path forward had been forged, and there seemed to be a shared understanding, almost an unspoken camaraderie, in the face of the challenge.\n\n\n**Decisions Reached:**\n\n* Redesign the verification email template to reduce its resemblance to spam.\n* Improve on-page messaging to guide users towards checking their spam folders for the verification email.\n\n**Action Items:**\n\n* **Sarah:**  Mock up revised on-page messaging.  **Due:** End of day today.\n* **Mike:**  Redesign and A/B test new email template versions.  **Due:** Friday.\n",
