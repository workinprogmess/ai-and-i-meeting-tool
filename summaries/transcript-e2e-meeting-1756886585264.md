@me: test and record, you record and test actually. And we're going to do the four segments again: microphone plus AirPods, system audio plus AirPods, then microphone minus AirPods and then system audio minus AirPods. Gemini is right now capturing pretty much everything except the fact that it's getting microphone without AirPods towards the end. And I think I'm like, I'm, I'm, I'm close to figuring out that it's probably to do with uh Gemini is sorting the whole transcript by device configuration or audio quality. Uh so it puts AirPods first and then system audio, system audio and then everything that's remaining goes to the end, which is mic without AirPods. So hopefully, you know, here uh we can see that uh it follows the correct chronology because we may have some better problems. Um so I hope that goes well. Um now I'm going to go ahead and create uh we'll create record a YouTube video. Uh we'll continue to play this guy, custom illustrators, custom illustrations and how it makes his app feel that much better.

@speaker1: Another way to add dimension to your app is haptic feedback. This is when you click a button, you touch the app and the phone kind of subtly vibrates and it gives this physical feedback back to the user. This is something that adds a lot of depth and honestly just makes the app a lot more fun to tap for the user. Something I noticed is that Apple's default apps barely use haptics. To be fair, there probably is a reason they don't have haptics. They're designing for a billion users. Maybe it's a battery thing or an accessibility thing, but we're not Apple, so we can probably make choices that they can't. So in my budgeting app Luna, almost every single button click has some sort of haptic feedback. Here's the key: not all haptic feedback is equal or feels the same. You can actually control the strength of the vibration in the

@me: Okay, that's great. We'll try that out. And now I'm going to take the AirPods off.  Hopefully the recording continues. The last time Gemini also captured it just that pushed all the way towards the end. So um keeping that in mind, this time I'm recording this for 30 seconds without AirPods. So I've not spoken a lot of words, but um the recording has gone on. I hope it stays. In another 5 seconds I'm going to go back and play that YouTube video which is about haptic feedback.  Three forty, we did it for three forty and seconds. Then I'm going to go ahead and uh stop the recording. Three forty nine.

@speaker1:  I recently hired a freelance illustrator to draw up some illustrations for me. And now I have a base mascot to work off of and make an infinite amount of variations on. I really do recommend starting with custom illustrations because it does make it feel a lot more original. If you can't do that, you can use ChatGPT to make these mascots for you. My advice is to be really creative when you do this. You're going to feed in reference images, try to feed in a bunch of different reference images. That way it just comes up with something a little bit more unique. Or really tweak the prompt and try to get creative to make it deviate from whatever references you're putting in. But again, if possible, I do recommend commissioning an artist or a graphic designer to do this for you. It's actually not as expensive as you might think. If you want to take it to another level, which is something I haven't even gotten to yet, you could animate these custom illustrations. So someone was actually kind enough to take the illustrations that I made and animate some of them using Rive. I was really impressed with the results and I do plan on adding these to the app. I haven't tried it yet, but I already know it's going to add a whole another layer to the app. So that's something I'm going to be trying soon and if you can, you should try it too.
