The meeting with the CTO to discuss the therapist app UI ran for 50 minutes and felt, at times, like several meetings happening at once.  Present were myself, the CTO, and Diddy (P. Diddy). The primary goal was to review the session prep screens.

The conversation started with the CTO explaining the logic behind the consultation card display.  It became clear that technical limitations around cloud access and data flow were impacting the intended UI.  The discussion became fragmented as Diddyâ€™s daughter entered, shifting the energy of the room dramatically.  Multiple threads emerged, ranging from language detection glitches (with humorous results due to the multilingual environment), to Diddy's daughter interacting directly with the CTO and myself.  This created a warm, chaotic interlude where the focus inevitably drifted from the app.  The CTO, however, maintained an impressive degree of professionalism throughout.

Once the familial interruption subsided, we returned to the session prep screens.  We discussed the distinctions between session prep for Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT) and regular therapy, agreeing that these should be handled differently within the app.  There was a brief detour into the nuances of painless vs. painful vaccinations, initiated by Diddy, before refocusing on the consultation protocol display.  The CTO clarified that the content was static, drawn from the backend, and would appear empty if the relevant data was missing.

**Decisions reached:**

* Agreed that session prep for CPT and regular therapy require distinct UI flows.
* Confirmed that consultation protocol is static and driven by backend data.

**Action Items:**

* **CTO:** Investigate alternative cloud solutions to address data access limitations impacting UI display of consultation card (Deadline: Next sprint planning).
* **You:**  Document the specific differences required for CPT vs. regular therapy session prep flows (Deadline: End of week).
* **CTO:** Confirm backend data requirements for populating consultation protocol and communicate any necessary adjustments (Deadline: End of week).
