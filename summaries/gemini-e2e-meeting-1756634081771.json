Microphone is the major issue. \n[01:02] @me: And also the timestamps on the transcripts how they play out. \n[01:21] @me: And uh yeah, so this is me, the microphone with AirPods and I'm gonna go ahead and play a YouTube video that should uh do the system audio plus AirPods thing. \n[02:00] @me: Uh, which one should I do?\n[02:56] @speaker1: Okay, that's great. We have Vidia Jensen speaking about how he reviews everyone's compensation. I hope you understand also it gets recorded after the video. So now I'm going to take off the mic take off the AirPods. I hope the switch is handled seamlessly. I hope the switch is handled seamlessly. This is without AirPods. Uh, I want to see this in the middle of the transcript as a third segment where I speak without AirPods. Without AirPods. Without AirPods. I'll say three times. Let's see. I'm gonna go back and \n[03:26] @speaker2: I wonder what our grandparents did. Let's chop this baby up. \n[03:30] @speaker3: What's the profit margin on a $5 lemonade? So with the lemon, the sugar, the water, the cup, everything involved, it's about 35¢. Include the labor, include the cost for the the booth itself, about 75¢. So you're clearing about $4.25 on every one you sell. So that's over 80% profit margin. What's the profit margin on a $5 lemonade? So with the lemon, the sugar,\n[03:36] @speaker1: It's great. Uh, we learned about what is the margin on a $5 lemonade, which is almost $4. That's great. And this is also something that I'm saying without the AirPods after the video. So this this should be the end of the transcript. All right, let's go. Bye-bye.\n\n\n",
