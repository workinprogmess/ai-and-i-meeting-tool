The power shifts back briefly to @speaker1 with the video, before @speaker2 takes over again with her personal updates.\n**energy/mood:** @speaker1 maintains a focused mood (游댯) throughout most of the conversation, shifting to some concern (游) when @speaker2 speaks. @speaker2 began with high distress (游댮游), then shifted to excitement (游리) when discussing her plans.\n\n### part 3: meeting classification\n**format:** ostensibly a 1:1 technical troubleshooting session.\n**formality level:** very informal, personal conversation, interspersed with work related activities.\n**relationship context:** husband and wife.\n\n### part 4: summary writing\n\n@speaker1 and @speaker2 met to discuss _audio troubleshooting_ with _mixed emotions_.  @speaker1 initially presented a 游댯focused explanation of the fixes implemented for several audio related issues.
