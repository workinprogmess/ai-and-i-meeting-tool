setting the stage 🔵**\n\n@speaker1: \"so, do you want to maybe give a really quick intro of yourself before we get started?\"\n(a polite and structured beginning, setting the expectation for a formal discussion)\n\n@speaker2: \"yeah sure... uh i'm [name] and good to be here today.\"\n(a straightforward introduction. seems slightly nervous or hesitant)\n\n\n**[0:03-0:07] introduction of the ai leverage mechanisms concept 🔵**\n\n@speaker2:  \"...i have been working on this ai stuff for a few years... i've been mainly focusing on ... and now i'm more on the agents side of things...\"\n(smooth transition from introduction to the core topic.  @speaker2 sounds more confident here, sharing his experience and current focus.)\n\n\n**[0:07-0:09] using an image as an analogy 🔵**\n\n@speaker2: \"...this chatgpt generated image of a flower...if you stare at this for like a minute or ten minutes, you don't really see any change. does that mean there is no change underlying this process?\"\n(introducing a unique and thought-provoking analogy to illustrate his point)\n\n\n**[0:09-2:40]  exploring the concept of \"leverage\" in the context of ai 🔵🟠**\n\n@speaker2:  \"...there is, and if you wait long enough then you'll see some big changes...what i'm trying to get at with this analogy is that... we're really not good at perceiving the changes that occur in, you know, like minute or like even day or years... but we're pretty good at minute and hour scale changes. so i think there's probably an evolutionary explanation for this...\"\n(explaining a core concept with a thoughtful and engaging tone.  a slight touch of concern 🟠 as he introduces the idea of limited human perception of long-term changes.)\n\n@speaker2: \"...i think actually ai is probably the fastest moving technology of all time. even then it doesn't move in like minutes or hours, it still moves over a few years timeframe or even decades. so i think given this deficiency...we might be underestimating the change, especially the magnitude of the change that ai is bringing about.\"\n(building the argument of ai's rapid advancement and its impact on our perception and understanding of change.  a clear focus 🔵 on presenting his perspective)\n\n@speaker2: \"...but i do want to emphasize that maybe what everyone's thinking about how big of this change is is very different...and if anything i think we might be underestimating it...and especially for this ai which i'm going to argue as a leverage mechanisms for individuals and humanity as a whole, that aspect might be somewhat underestimated.\"\n(clearly stating the main claim that the impact of AI is underestimated. the tone is persuasive and assertive. )\n\n@speaker2: \"...for me the first encounter of this concept was probably classical mechanics where we have this lever...so in this case...the lever, if we enlarge this lever...we can actually you know lift up heavier objects...this means that the input downward force is the same, but by increasing the leverage the output was increased by 3x...this is a very general concept.  it's a mechanism through which a small change or no change in input results in a larger change or a very large change in output.\"\n(clearly explaining the concept of leverage using the example of a lever.  explaining this foundational concept builds the credibility for the rest of the presentation)\n\n@speaker2:  \"...and this is a very general thing and it's not just about the classical mechanics context...i think it can be applied to many other places... this is a very important concept and you know we many people want to increase the output. i want to contribute more, i want to generate more... then the first thing that comes to our mind is probably how do i work harder...how can i increase my input...\"\n(further building the argument. he transitions smoothly from the physical world example to the human world and emphasizes the need for output increase)\n\n@speaker2: \"...but i think there's a certain limit to it. instead the more important question is how do i increase the output without actually increasing the input...or how can i disconnect the relationship between the input and the output... and that is getting at the core of this leverage mechanism...\"\n(pivots from the traditional approach of increasing input to the more important question of leverage, which is the main focus of this presentation)\n\n@speaker2: \"...according to naval, there are three types of leverage... human labor, capital, and code and media...let's think about these things individually...\"\n(Introducing the ideas of Naval Ravikant, adding external authority to the presentation)\n\n@speaker2: \"...human labor is the oldest type of leverage...as an example let's think about a scenario where i want to build a pyramid...without leverage i would be building alone...and with leverage i can hire thousands of human workers...but the output is much higher because there are thousands of people working on this...the second type is capital...third type is more recent thing, especially more common in the bay area which is the code and software...if i write a code for an app, and then there's one user who gets value and let's suppose that number is positive. and while i'm sleeping, one more user downloads it and gets another value. so i'll put this double without me having to do any additional work...a lot of the recent value has been created leveraging this...\"\n(thorough explanation of three types of leverage: human labor, capital, and code/media. the examples are clear, and illustrative)\n\n@speaker2: \"...in historically large wealth creation...utilized these forms of leverage...the 20th century wealth creation...leveraged a lot of this capital leverage. and then recently, especially in the bay area, tech companies have leveraged the fact that if you write a code, the output can be multiplied pretty much indefinitely.\"\n(connect the three types of leverage with historical examples of wealth creation.  he provides specific contexts which strengthen his reasoning)\n\n@speaker2: \"...but then the upside of the leverage mechanism is also competed away...if something is good then many people realize it and that's going to be competition... if you start a company that is only leveraging the fact that it's software doesn't leverage other technologies then it's probably much harder to succeed now compared to 20 years ago...what i'm trying to get at is when this leverage mechanism is just became possible because of some technology, much larger values and returns are possible then and then it's going to be competed away. so i think it's very important to think about what are the new leverage mechanisms that are becoming available.\"\n(introducing the challenge:  leverage mechanisms create advantages which are eventually competed away.)\n\n@speaker2: \"...so obviously i'm going to argue that ai is the relatively new one that is coming into the picture and it's slowly expanding its scope and reach...to from an individual level to groups of people and to the point where it can benefit humanity as a whole...let's maybe start looking at this at an individual level...i personally use ai for me is in education context...i think i spent a lot of time, especially weekends, learning about new concepts...asking... now i think talking about this even hours and just learning about new things...\"\n(transitioning to the core discussion about ai as a new leverage mechanism, starting with the impact on individuals)\n\n@speaker2: \"...if you think about leverage, when i think about ai as a leverage, this learning, what is an input and output, the input is my time and effort to understand some concept that i don't understand and the output is the conceptual understanding happening in my brain and maybe also some knowledge...with ai this given input results in larger output...let's say if i'm trying to learn some specific things about a distributed system...then before this kind of a generative ai i would have to google this and then probably a wikipedia page, which is typically not beginner friendly...now because ai can contextualize everything i know and generate dynamically just the right amount of materials at the right difficulty, i can much learn much easier.\"\n(demonstrates ai's benefits in his own life. provides a clear example of ai's leverage effect by comparing pre and post ai experience.  sounds enthusiastic and confident 🟡)\n\n@speaker2:  \"...i think that's the big lesson from the learning...what i'm saying is the barrier to learn new area is like collapsing essentially...this is good, and you probably heard about this a lot, but is this good everywhere?...i think there's some we have to be careful and have a comprehensive look...when everything is easier to learn, people are learning everything, then there is an opportunity cost of not learning is getting higher...\"\n(a shift to the potential downsides and wider implications of easy access to knowledge.  a shift from excitement 🟡 to slight concern 🟠)\n\n@speaker2: \"...as an extreme example if you don't use ai, you just don't think about it at all, and you just do your thing, you're not lazy just doing your own thing and everyone else is just learning new things and getting better and so on then you're kind of behind in society. that's the opportunity cost...but just because its relatively decided what the valuable skill is, that's what's happening...yeah i think the in society the valuable skill is determined based on the supply and demand of what is scarce...as opposed to an objective value it provides...\"\n(illustrates this opportunity cost with an example, and highlights the shift from objective value to scarcity as a driver of skill valuation.)\n\n@speaker2: \"...i think one extreme example is human vision...it's from objective perspective this is extremely complicated and advanced feature...but this incredible capability is so abundant that it's having that doesn't help you excelling in modern society...scarcity is a very important necessary condition for any highly valuable skill...what are some great skills or opportunities to have...whatever evolution did not teach equip us then that's kind of a good starting point because if it did then everyone has it built into dna and that's probably not that scarce...\"\n(introduces the concept of scarcity and how it relates to valuable skills.  this section demonstrates in-depth knowledge and thinking.)\n\n@speaker2: \"...that's kind of the some implications of learning getting easier...and so the acquisition of the new knowledge gets cheap the scarcest factor is the motivation to explore and curiosity is kind of the characteristics that probably will be more important...well i mean it has been always important but i think it's getting more and more because the learning cost is going down but not zero...learning a new concept is not something that i would say everyone finds pleasing because you feel challenged and this cognitive challenge is not comfortable...and so to overcome that curiosity can be i know there's a pain but i need to get this because i'm so curious about it...if you're not curious i think there's a way to have a correction mechanism...which is okay i'm going to go through this short-term pain but there will be a long-term reward...if you build in enough of this reward something can get over it...more broadly technology changes what is scarce...just being aware of such changes even if you're not directly contributing to it is very important.\"\n(summarizes the implications of decreasing learning costs. the most valuable trait is curiosity, either intrinsic or reinforced by a reward mechanism. )\n\n@speaker2: \"...that's one learning affecting learning is one way ai is acting as a leverage. the other maybe more intuitive one is this ai agent...this is probably the most interesting research area in 2025 and many more...here ai agent is combining the two types of leverage mechanisms that we saw before...the first one's the human labor because ai agent is doing the work for you...and then the second part is at least the current ai agents are you know software only...you can copy and paste...if you want 10 output 10 agents working together, just do it. if you want 12, just copy two more and you don't have to ask for the permission, this permission-less form of composite leverage mechanism that i think is quite profound...i think that's going to be main source of wealth generation going forward and this thing is very new, i think it's just got started...\"\n(detailed explanation of ai agents as a new form of leverage, combining previous mechanisms.  he sounds excited and engaged 🟡.)\n\n\n@speaker2: \"...if you have used deep research, that's to me the most well functioning ai agent as of now. there will be more probably, but that's at least the kind of the first working agent for me...and so that increases my output by a lot...so individuals are quite supercharged and this means small teams consist of individuals generating really big values...that's becoming more and more common. so in you might heard about startups with 10 people 20 people generating hundreds of millions of dollars of revenue...that's probably unimaginable 10 years ago...but now still uncommon but we're seeing this and i think behind the scene it's more of an ai acting as a leverage...previously if you want to increase the output then you again, you want to think about the leverage mechanism and after raising funds...then you have to really think about this human labor leverage...but human collaboration, especially at larger scale, has quite a bit of overhead...there's communication...it's a very difficult problem...just adding one person to 100 person group doesn't mean the output goes up by 1%. it can even be negative...now with supercharged individuals this overhead is becoming less favorable...we'll see more and more of smaller teams generating quite a bit of value...and more of companies might be of this size...and obviously there will be big companies but this might be a more common thing.\"\n(discusses the implications for teams and organizations. explains how ai could change the dynamics of team work and size of companies)\n\n\n@speaker2: \"...and i think so far this has been like individual level and some implications of the group as a result...i think there slowly again this is like the flower analogy from the beginning, this is a change that is very big but it's so slow that i think it's kind of an underestimated by many people and it's acting at the humanities level...let's think about this...so if we think about all of humans here, what is the task or goals we might have...i think there's no right answer but to me one of the most important things is to continue to generate value and to thrive...what is the most sustainable engines of growth and value creation...there are many but for me the most sustainable engine is scientific advances, discovering new knowledge...suddenly what you think about as a thought about as a non resource just becomes resource because now you have new knowledge to leverage that...many instances like that...here if we think about from historical perspective, since 17th century or roughly that time scientific revolution, the wealth creation just like really took off and like hockey stick shape of economic metric...and back then there was there were probably a lot of low-hanging fruits in terms of scientific progress because if you're the first one to do science, then probably there's a lot of easy things to do...i'm not saying everything was easy because there's other challenges given the context but still from an objective complexity perspective, this is probably much easier than what is happening now. so advancing science in modern society is a lot more complicated...maybe we can think about newtonian versus quantum mechanics...or if you want to make advanced chip making advanced computer chips, that is probably beyond any single human's capability way beyond that...\"\n(a transition to broader societal implications. focuses on the importance of scientific progress and its sustainability. shifts back to concern 🟠 and reflection.)\n\n\n@speaker2: \"...it's getting a lot more complicated and involves sometimes involves larger collaborations among people and more capital and so on...in addition to this increasing complexity of technologies, human intelligence is not growing... i don't even know it's growing but it's kind of stagnant compared to the rate at which the scientific complexity increases...so these factors put together i think are kind of the bottlenecks in further advancing this core mission of keeping advancing scientific progress...so we have done great job whenever just a bottleneck happens we find a way to get out of it and we build the tools to unblock ourselves from achieving the mission...this time i think we should do the same thing with ai being this tool that will be the most useful thing and maybe even better than superhuman in the research capability so that we can continue this scientific advances...and i think there are many purposes of ai but to me this is the most important, single most important purpose of it is to augment in continuing this grand mission of scientific advances.\"\n(analyzes the challenges and bottlenecks in scientific advancement, highlighting the role of ai as a solution.)\n\n\n@speaker2: \"...so now again just from the perspective of the leverage, let's think about the input and the output. the input is the collective human effort, scientists here and there, just working together or like implicitly together and then the output is the scientific progress of all...what how can ai act as a leverage here...i'm gonna mention like two different things, first one is when actually let's think about this...we highly encourage being a specialist especially in the scientific community...so there are small number of people who have specialized knowledge and they are kind of segregated in different even you know locations and communities and so on...so it's hard to collaborate you might not even know what is available option for collaboration across different expertise areas...and so to me this if you think about this human knowledge a mental picture i have is a very sharp in high dimensional space and that's like here and there and there's so much space between them...and i think ai is acting as a kind of an envelope around this spiky space and connecting all these you know specialist knowledge...if you're familiar with optimization this is like convex hull...and i think this is the one of the roles of ai...when i was working on the deep research this wasn't really obvious but as i worked more and more and get more value out of it this is kind of the mental picture i started building...here i'm trying to get at this human experts being very specialized but their cooperation has communication physical separations all these overhead and this ai is kind of making that much more efficient...what i think is might be happening already is because of those separations and unable to cooperate in an efficient manner, we might have a huge overhang of existing knowledge synthesis...so even with just combining the existing knowledge we might be able to get a lot of value and maybe we can call that new knowledge...those are i think completely uncharted territory just because of how experts have grown and the communication bottlenecks of many many people...and so these are i think the low-hanging fruits of ai acting as a leverage to advancing the science mission...but i don't think that's enough, we should probably go beyond and maybe just going forward we can expect advanced reasoning, maybe even better than human scientists and then ability to generate new ideas and knowledge...i think this is still rare and maybe i'm hearing some you know vague anecdotes that these are possible...but i think it can go a lot more than that and so i would expect that this kind of abilities emerge in the future generations of the model if not already in there and once that happens this will be you know just nonstop being research engine that works all the time and then they can work together across humans and agents and so on...this will be the main leverage factor going forward how ai can help this mission of the scientific progress...\"\n(summarizing the core argument and highlighting the potential of ai in connecting specialized knowledge and fostering scientific breakthroughs.  the energy is high 🟡 and confident)\n\n@speaker2: \"...that's all i have today and i've talked about many different concepts but i think ai is just important thing everyone knows that but i would invite you to think about is this how big of a change am i thinking about and is there a possibility that i might be underestimating that magnitude especially now that you think about from new form of leverage...i would invite you to think about this yeah that's it thanks.\"\n(concluding the presentation with a call to action and invitation for further reflection.  a confident and slightly playful closing 🟡)\n\n@speaker1: \"thanks so much... uh so your final point actually reminded me of something we talked about a couple weeks ago in the class called uh do you guys remember what it was called?\"\n(a polite and friendly closing from @speaker1, with a clear interest in the topic)\n\n@speaker1: \"...we talked about the singularity and how ai intelligence will reach a level where they surpass human intellect...do you think it relates to concepts such as that?\"\n(a transition to a discussion of the singularity, connecting the presented ideas to a broader context.)\n\n@speaker2: \"...let me actually pause the recording now that time's over...not because i'm going to say something...\"\n(interruption, pausing the recording to continue discussion more informally)\n\n@speaker1:  \"...if you're pausing the recording also i can show you what the class looks like so maybe it's more interactive that way.\"\n(proactive suggestion to enhance the conversation)\n\n@speaker2: \"yep sure let me pause it first...\"\n(agreement and completing the recording pause)\n\n\n## summary\n\ncreate human-like meeting summary using comprehensive approach:\n\n### part 1: meeting dna analysis\n**core theme:**  the underestimated transformative power of ai as a leverage mechanism, and its implications for individual learning, collaboration, and scientific progress.\n\n**context clusters:**\n* introduction of ai and the speaker's work\n* the concept of leverage, with examples from classical mechanics and the work of Naval Ravikant\n* ai's impact on individual learning\n* ai's impact on collaboration and organization structure\n* ai's potential role in accelerating scientific progress\n* comparison of ai's impact with the singularity\n\n\n**emphasis patterns:**  the recurring theme is the \"leverage\" mechanism of ai—how it amplifies output beyond the input.\n\n**side moments:** using a chatgpt generated image of a blooming flower to illustrate the idea of gradual, yet transformative change.  The conversation momentarily deviates from the formal presentation style and shifts to a more interactive mode after the recording is paused.\n\n\n### part 2: relationship dynamics  \n**individual goals:** @speaker2 wanted to present his ideas about ai as a leverage mechanism and provoke thought on its implications. @speaker1 was interested in understanding the ideas and possibly connect them to broader concepts discussed in a previous class session.\n\n**satisfaction levels:** both seemed satisfied. the conversation flowed well with occasional pauses and moments of both speakers thinking through.\n\n**power dynamics:** @speaker2 led the discussion. @speaker1 facilitated and prompted.\n\n**energy/mood:**  @speaker2 exhibited a blend of focused concentration and enthusiastic engagement. @speaker1 maintained a consistently receptive and inquisitive demeanor.\n\n\n### part 3: meeting classification\n**format:** presentation/discussion (with a shift toward more informal interaction at the end).\n**formality level:** mostly structured, transitioning to more casual at the end.\n**relationship context:** peers (academic/educational setting).\n\n\n### part 4: summary writing\nuse lowercase, @person references, _topic emphasis_, conversational warm tone, match meeting's actual energy\n\n**opening context:**\n\"@speaker1 and @speaker2 met to discuss the _underestimated impact of ai as a leverage mechanism_ with a thoughtful and engaging energy...\"\n\n**main content by theme clusters:**\n@speaker2 gave a really interesting presentation on how _ai is a new, powerful leverage mechanism_. he started by explaining leverage with classical mechanics and then tied it to the work of naval ravikant, describing human labor, capital, and code/media as three historical leverage types.  he then showed how _ai is transforming individual learning_, making it easier to acquire knowledge, and changing what is considered a scarce or valuable skill.  he argued that _ai will radically impact organizations_, allowing smaller teams to achieve much more.  the conversation even touched on the potentially _transformative nature of ai's impact on scientific progress_, comparing it to the concept of the singularity.  the presentation used analogies, and examples to support its core concepts.\n\n**closing assessment:**\nthe meeting ended amicably. @speaker1 expressed appreciation for the presentation.  the conversation naturally shifted to a more informal discussion on the singularity and related ideas.  the next steps weren't explicitly discussed but were implicitly about the implications of the conversation in the future discussions.\n\n\n### part 5: advanced insights\n**the one key thing:** ai is a powerful new leverage mechanism with far-reaching implications, that may be significantly underestimated due to its gradual but profound influence on our world.\n\n**unresolved questions:**  further exploration of the connection between ai's leverage and the singularity.\n\n**memorable moments:** the chatgpt-generated flower analogy was highly memorable, serving as an insightful illustration of the slowly unfolding change brought on by ai. the discussion of ai's role in augmenting scientific progress.\n\n**specific action items:** none explicitly assigned.  the meeting concludes with an implicit invitation for continued thought and further discussions on the topics explored.\n",
