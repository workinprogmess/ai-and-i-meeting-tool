Um, and we're testing same things, microphone plus AirPods, system audio plus AirPods, microphone minus AirPods, system audio minus AirPods. I'm going to play YouTube video in the and um yeah, because I don't have the other speaker. The speaker or the call with another person which means so I'm going to play YouTube video and uh and see if the system audio is recording well. This time we're doing two separate files and share two separate files at J M N I uh and expected to chronologically place how the video sort of flows. Uh there's still much simpler than the actual meeting because like an actual meeting people can speak with each other so the timestamps could mix up, speakers could mix up, all those things can happen. Uh anyways, uh at least let's test how good it does in this bit. I'm going to I'm going to play this question, should we be scared of AI and this guy answers. \n\n[01:53] @speaker1: because AI is pretty fascinating AI. I've been I've been asking AI some questions to ask me. Obviously, doesn't know it's me, but it sort of it scours the internet, finds out everything it can about me and that question.  In a second. And then answers it in its own words. I know it's it is a you know what I mean? So so this is uh this is the question I asked AI to answer to you, right? Um asked Ricky Gervais a masterclass question about stand-up. So I gave it a clue that I wanted it to be about the craft and stuff. In one second, it asked me this question. How do you balance crafting provocative material that challenges societal norms while ensuring the audience remains engaged and doesn't feel alienated, particularly when tackling sensitive topics? And then it explains why it asked that question. It says, this question draws on Gervais's reputation for pushing boundaries with his humor as seen in specials like Armageddon and Mortality, while inviting insight into his approach to audience connection and comedic delivery. It did that in one second. It's mental.\n\n[03:51] @speaker2: I want to play for you one of the most chilling clips I've ever heard. And just hold on and trust me cuz it's not that chilling until you realize what it means. The basic idea was that uh we could never win an election on getting certain things because we were in such a small minority. But maybe you could actually unilaterally change the world without having to constantly convince people and beg people and plead with people who are never gonna agree with you through technological means. And this is where I think um technology is this incredible alternative to politics. That's tech billionaire and Republican mega donor Peter Thiel speaking at a Libertopia, a libertarian conference in 2010. He's basically saying that his political ideology is so unappealing that it'll never win elections. And that's one thing he's right about cuz he's railed against women having the right to vote, complained so much about diversity and written some really disgusting stuff about sexual assault and consent. But he knows that he can use technology as a unilateral alternative to politics. And that should really freak you out. Thiel is one of the co-founders and biggest investors in Palantir, a CIA-funded technology company that has contracts across the government for their data software. Here's their CFO speaking a few years ago. We continue to advance our mission of becoming the US government's central operating system as we extend our footprint across defense, healthcare, and civilian agencies. And while both President Obama and Biden did sign Palantir contracts, President Trump is taking it way further. There are new contracts with ICE, something who literally called Immigration OS and the IRS. So, 15 years ago Peter Thiel, like the supervillain in a movie explaining his plan to the hero, admitted that he can use technology to get his ideas across when they're unpopular, completely subverting democracy. And today one of his technology companies is gaining more and more power within the government, building the very systems our government relies on. And oh yeah. This is the CEO. The central risk to Palantir and America and the world is uh a regressive way of thinking that is corrupting and corroding our institutions that calls itself progressive but actually and is called woke but is actually a form of a thin pagan religion. If you're progressive, if you have progressive values, meaning you just I don't know, care about other people, the CEO of the company building America's technological back end thinks of you as the central risk. He thinks of you as the enemy. Are these the people you want running the systems you rely on or worse the systems that surveil you?\n\n[06:27] @me:  Okay, so that was that.
