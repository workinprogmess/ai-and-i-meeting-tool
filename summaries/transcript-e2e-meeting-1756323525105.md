[0:00-0:30]  _technical issues_ ðŸ”µðŸŸ 
@speaker1 is troubleshooting a recording issue.  The tone is focused but also tinged with concern as they describe problems with the UI and the cost resetting to zero.

[0:00] @speaker1: "it's time for a new recording and it's in progress... the time goes on... new meeting shows up on the sidebar but the UI is off and broken. okay. why is that? we'll come to that. by the way on this screen the cost has gone back to zero."
(technical explanation of the problem, slightly frustrated tone)

[0:07] @speaker1: "uh on this when the recording is in progress... so there are two fixes to be done. one is the sidebar UI and the cost going back to zero."
(reiterating the issues, still focused on problem-solving)

[0:20] @speaker1: "uh and again go back to youtube and play something. let's say this dialogue..."
(moves to testing the system with a youtube clip)


[0:30-1:30] _youtube clip analysis_ ðŸ”µ
@speaker1 plays a youtube video clip and comments on its audio. The focus is purely on technical aspects - testing the system.

[0:30] (youtube audio plays) "...this movie starts at a hundred miles an hour, right in the middle of the conversation..."


[1:30-2:30] _youtube clip analysis continued_ ðŸ”µ
@speaker1 continues analyzing the youtube clip, focusing on the number of takes needed to achieve a scene, noting the numerous takes in the video. The emotional tone is neutral, purely observation-based.

[1:36] @speaker1: "david fincher shot that scene 99 times... 99 takes over two nights of a very simple scene... they averaged about 25 takes of a scene... but uh he did many, many takes.  not it's not because the first 98 takes were no good but by through that kind of repetition..."
(observational notes, no specific emotion)

[2:30-3:00] _technical analysis_ ðŸ”µ
@speaker1 returns to the technical aspect, discussing multiple speakers in the youtube video and how the system processes them.


[2:37] @speaker1:  "okay so there are multiple speakers in this youtube video. let's see how gemini does on that."
(checking if the system accurately captures multiple speakers)

[3:00-3:30] _meeting conclusion_ ðŸŸ¢
@speaker1 wraps up the meeting, ending the recording.  The emotion here is neutral, indicating the end of a troubleshooting session.

[3:00] @speaker1: "i'm going to stop recording now."
(concluding the meeting)
