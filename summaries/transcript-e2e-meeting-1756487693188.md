[0:00-0:45] initial exploration & focused curiosity ðŸ”µ

brief intro, speaker seems interested in testing Gemini's capabilities for summarizing articles.

[0:00] @v: "trying again and um i want to go back to reading an article again to see if gemini summarizes what i read or gives it line by line. i hope it gives line by line. fine. let's go. this is about why llms can't really build software."
(curious exploration of AI capabilities, specifically Gemini's summarization features)

[topic shift] to the core discussion: limitations of LLMs in software development

[0:45-2:30] analytical observation & thoughtful reflection ðŸ”µ

speaker observes their experiences interviewing software engineers, reflecting on what makes them effective. the focus is on the importance of maintaining clear mental models.

[1:00] @v: "one of the things i've spent a lot of time doing is interviewing software engineers. this is obviously a hard task and i don't i don't claim to have a magic solution, but it gives me some time to reflect on more effective software engineers... on what effective software engineers actually do... in the software engineering loop."
(insightful observation about their work and approach)

[1:30] @v: "and when you watch someone who knows what they're doing, you will see them looping over the following steps: build a mental model of the requirements, build a mental model of what the code actually does, identify the differences, and update the code to the requirements."
(describing a key process followed by expert software engineers)

[2:30-4:30] comparison & contrast: LLMs vs. human engineers ðŸ”µðŸŸ 

speaker contrasts the abilities of LLMs and human engineers, highlighting LLMs' deficiency in building and maintaining mental models.  this leads to some concern about the limitations.

[2:45] @v: "there are a lot of different ways to do these things, but the distinguishing factor of effective engineers is their ability to maintain clear mental models.  however llms... to be fair, llms are very good at writing code. they're also reasonably good at updating code when you identify a problem to fix. but what they cannot do is maintain clear mental models."
(clear distinction drawn between LLM and human capabilities)

[3:30] @v: "llms get endlessly confused as to even if the code they wrote actually works. when the tests fail they're left guessing as to whether to fix the code or the tests and when they get frustrated they just delete the whole lot and start over."
(illustrative example highlighting LLM limitations)

[4:00] @v: "exactly the opposite of what we're looking for in software engineers. they test their work as they go, and if the tests fail, they check their mental model, decide whether to fix the code or the tests or just gather more data before making a decision. and if they get frustrated they can reach for help and talking things through."
(comparing and contrasting problem solving strategies, emphasizing human collaboration)


[4:30-5:30]  future implications & potential solutions ðŸ”µðŸŸ 

the conversation shifts to exploring how the limitations of LLMs might change with future improvements in technology.  there is a sense of cautious optimism.

[4:45] @v: "will this change as models become more capable? perhaps. but i think this is going to require a change at how models are built and optimized. software engineering requires models that can do more than just generate code."
(forward-looking perspective, acknowledging the need for model evolution)

[5:30-7:00]  detailed analysis of current LLM limitations ðŸ”µðŸŸ 

speaker dives deeper into the context switching and recency bias problems impacting LLMs.

[5:45] @v: "we know that current generative models suffer from several issues that directly impact their ability to maintain a coherent mental model: context omission, models are bad at finding omitted context, recency bias, there are very strong recency biases in the context window. they use and include completely contextual details that should not be there."
(detailed explanation of technical limitations)


[7:00-7:45]  mitigation strategies & closing thoughts ðŸŸ¢

speaker discusses potential solutions, highlighting the need for human oversight, and concludes with a hopeful vision of human-AI collaboration.


[7:15] @v:  "these are hopefully not insurmountable problems... work is being done... to let them perform similar mental tricks to us. unfortunately, for now, they can't go beyond certain complexity and understand what is going on. they can't build software because they can't maintain these similar mental models and identify the differences and fix the code or the requirements."
(summary of the limitations and the ongoing work to address them)

[7:30] @v: "for some tasks this is enough. for some tasks this is enough, the requirements are clear enough, the problems are simple enough that they can one-shot the whole thing. but not trivial. they're not capable of maintaining enough context accurately enough to iterate to a working solution. yet, the software engineers are responsible for ensuring that the requirements are clear and the code actually does what it proposes to do. and then we believe in a world where programmers and reasons can collaborate together to build better software. but for now we formally believe that at least for now your AI is just another tool to reach out for."
(summarizing the current capabilities and the vision for the future)


[7:45-end]  loose ends & future exploration ðŸ”µ

speaker briefly mentions "zed" (unclear what this refers to) and briefly touches on next generation code editors.

[7:50] @v: "zed? what is zed? i don't know what zed is... zed... the next generation code editor does not require human intervention... ok let's check it out."
(mention of "zed" â€“ the context is unclear, and this is followed by a quick mention of next-generation code editors)
