The tone is focused but tinged with concern about the previous recording's issues.\n\n[0:00] @speaker1: \"ahead again and um this time i want to go long like 10 minutes and i think i'm gonna go back to discussing the same questions uh from milestone 3.2 uh the recording didn't save earlier on and which led to a series of uh back and forth with cloud and digging into why there might be a crash why the recording might be failing etc etc.\"\n(reviewing past challenges)\n\n[0:45-2:00] _minimal viable product (mvp) definition_ ðŸ”µ\n@speaker1 focuses on defining the MVP, emphasizing the importance of non-disruptive workflow. The tone is focused and practical.\n\n[0:55] @speaker1: \"the key questions are what is the minimal viable art experience that does not disrupt current workflows what is the current workflow there is no auth there's no authentication i have this running on my local machine i can't download it from the app store right now uh because we don't have apple developer account actually let me do that tonight as well apple developer account um so so so i simply i have it open my dude and then npm start from the terminal\"\n(defining MVP requirements)\n\n\n[2:00-3:30] _technical explanation of current setup_ ðŸ”µ\n@speaker1 explains the current technical setup using Gemini for transcription, highlighting the current process of transcription and summary generation.\n\n[2:00] @speaker1: \"and i record the recording you know the recording audio file goes to gemini gemini then transcribes in a certain way we have prompted it to and then this is the transcript generates a summary again so we've prompted it to and shows up on this nice little minimal interface this is it and i can go on to record over and over again uh that's what it is so the minimal viable art\"\n(explaining current tech setup)\n\n\n[3:30-4:30] _authentication discussion_ ðŸŸ \n@speaker1 raises questions about authentication, noting its absence and its implications.  Concern is evident regarding user identification.\n\n[3:30] @speaker1: \"what we should do right now i think we should let's say we have a sign in uh i sign in with my account with my email what's gonna change so i sign in with an email uh and uh sign in with my email okay let's let's say if i do let's say if i do have gmail for instance and not doing a sign in gmail that's it you can't do anything else for instance uh sign in authentication happens uh what does that do let's say sign in how does it help me why there's no authentication i would continue doing authentication even let's say it's not from the apps not not actually let's say from the website or whatever not\"\n(questioning the need and effect of authentication)\n\n[4:30-6:00] _user profile and personalization_ ðŸ”µ\n@speaker1 discusses the importance of user profiles for personalization and a more human-like experience. The focus is on enhancing the user interaction.\n\n[4:45] @speaker1: \"stays in the system uh but there's no authentication it's only a profile i don't know who the user is i don't know their email the only thing i know obviously maybe there's a name something i ask them what's their name etc and i know this user by the name maybe they can choose a username for instance to create a distinct identity that's it but i don't know how to reach out to them that's fine you know i can figure something out about that and that's like that's it and uh we and right being okay and we need that one thing is because you know just brings the the the thing to life you know the the personalize the personalize transcript because the transcript keeps speak speak to you if you have a name or username something like that and we can also have let's say a name or a username for your other people which which is again necessary for the same reason that they're talking to with the sign up because some sort of identification if not with emails there's people there right there's something we can work out uh yeah we can do that and uh the personalization comes that you were talking to let's say uh the user b maybe he's a new user here maybe he's a user then we can you know maybe there's a way to send from the backend that user i think the personalization like how somebody comes to like you know to speak to you about you know the people you know stuff they're talking about those kind of aspects are very important to generate a human something\"\n\n(discussing user profiles)\n\n[6:00-7:00]  _authentication vs. profile creation_ ðŸ”µðŸŸ \n@speaker1 weighs the importance of authentication against the creation of user profiles, leaning toward prioritizing profile creation for personalization. There's a blend of focus and some underlying concern about the technical complexity.\n\n[6:00] @speaker1: \"uh so those layer authentication and authentication is like how to build some sort of a profile for a profile of the user uh which is the more important thing here than let's say authentication i'm not sure if authentication should have a word with cloud it do really email or some sort of a sign up here i think my bigger thing is like uh how to build profiles so personalize it make it so very human you know it speaks to you something like that and then there is uh this layer about you know whether we save the data on their profile like you know on the local machine or we sort of save it on uh the cloud i think it should be the cloud it's can be well send like from the cloud\"\n(prioritizing profile over authentication)\n\n\n[7:00-7:45] _wrap-up and next steps_ ðŸŸ¢\n@speaker1 summarizes their thoughts, acknowledges the remaining time, and signals the end of the meeting.
