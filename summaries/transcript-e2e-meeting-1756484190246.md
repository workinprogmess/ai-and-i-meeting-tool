[0:00-0:30] initial technical difficulties ðŸŸ 
@v is trying to record a meeting but encounters problems with the recording system.  the system seems to be crashing or recording in short bursts, causing frustration.

[0:00] @v: "the meetings are not getting recorded. the system is crashing or..."
(frustration evident in tone)

[0:08] @v: "...the meeting is only recording...recording for a chunk and after that something happens. i want to see like what is that."
(problem-solving mode, trying to diagnose the issue)

[0:18] @v: "uh i have to  then minimize something to do with minimizing the screen when...when i'm recording. let's try that. i'm at 31 seconds. let's see. uh let's see now."
(testing a solution, hopeful but still uncertain)


[0:30-1:00] troubleshooting continues ðŸ”µ
@v continues testing whether minimizing the screen resolves the recording issue.  there is a focus on problem-solving.

[0:36] @v: "okay so um i minimized it. i'm still talking. i'm still talking. and obviously it's going on. it's gone 45 seconds."
(observing the outcome of the solution, cautiously optimistic)

[1:00-1:30] continued testing and observations ðŸ”µðŸŸ 
@v continues to monitor the recording, noting that the problem seems intermittent.  a mix of focus and concern are visible.

[1:15] @v: "uh obviously going on again and again and again and finally now stopped. it's one minute now almost. let's see. let me end it at a minute."
(observing the recording, still some unresolved concern)

[1:30-1:31] meeting end ðŸŸ¢
the recording abruptly stops.
