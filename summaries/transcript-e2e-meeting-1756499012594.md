(reiterating the key point, answering the previous question)

[9:15] @speaker1: "i think so i'm not really thinking about investors at least right now i think it should be a very very profitable business probably like 80% gross margin pe operate karna chahiye main may be let's say agar thoda sa kuch power users honge woh jyada use karenge toh may be like 50 60% toh agar main jitna paisa kama raha hu usse main shayad aadha paisa kharch kar raha hu so that that should be the math ultimately should come out toh ideally should not be but uh scale karna hota hai aapko toh toh but i'm not thinking about scale right now i just want"

[9:45] @speaker1: "oh yeah see think about it think about it thoda chhota toh think about that that's what i'm thinking about right now imagine i have 1000 paying users toh sochke dekh ek baari ke liye and i'm not even thinking really big 1000 paying users achievable number in the next whatever time six months one year whatever now 1000 paying users let's say if i charge 25 dollars a month which is the lowest in this category that's 25000 dollars a month jis mein se maan le agar main jis mein se maan le agar main 10000 dollar kharch bhi kar raha hu har mahine ke i still am making like 15000 dollars abhi main thoda mota mota math bata raha hu"
