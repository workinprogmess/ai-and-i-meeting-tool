  "fullOutput": "@me: Okay, alright, I'm going ahead again and check this part because I think the recording starts like 2 or 3 seconds later, so I'll check with a lot of that.\n\n@me: Now, uh, the thing is that in the last time we actually tried\n\n@me: track technology, the track technology was something new for the first time, literally for the first time to be held transport on the road, flow, and the five steps in the road.\n\n@me: I recorded first with AirPods, then I played a video with AirPods on, then I then I've said something without AirPods, then I played the video without AirPods, and finally I said something again at the end of it.\n\n@me: It's great and everything laid out in the perfect order, order, but it must have a wired to align between here and there, and I hope that, you know, this works better this time.\n\n@me: The missing lines, but I'm also going to see like how the transcripts generally are.\n\n@me: If we get to like 90, 98%, uh, 91% accuracy, I think this should be good and I can move on to much more core and differentiating factors which is human intelligence, etcetera, that I'm going to bring to the whole meeting.\n\n@me: And that's going to be an interesting problem to solve and we'll also take like a lot of back and forth, to and fro.\n\n@me: But I just want to be sure right now with the reliability and I really hope that we nearly\n\n@me: after that also I'm going to test a few more recordings just to be sure that it's working, maybe even do a recording with or a call with Preem, to see how the back and forth video or audio meetings play out.\n\n@me: Anyway, I'm going to go ahead quickly and play a YouTube video about the same to\n\n@me: interesting video.\n\n@me: Thank you.\n\n@me: Okay, that's great.\n\n@me: The dual list definitely looks good.\n\n@me: Um, I will try Magic Path for sure.\n\n@me: I think probably it might be, you know, a good way to prototype uh, some of the UI instead of cloud code.\n\n@me: We have the wireframe and then, you know, we can then just give the instructions back to Magic Path.\n\n@me: That's what I'm going to try, Figma part, Figma Make though.\n\n@me: It should be good, at least in prototype bit.\n\n@me: And I'm guessing the Make designs can actually and then be imported into Figma and then it can change, updated, you know, edited, do whatever.\n\n@me: Anyways, so I'm going to go back, take my AirPods off and uh, speak.\n\n@me: I'm expecting that uh, I want to see a near perfect something this time.\n\n@me: Um, it's been like 3, 4 days that I've been struggling with getting the transcript right and it just seems like right now they're very close.\n\n@me: And we may not have to do go uh, to that completely architectural\n\n@me: approach uh, to do cascaded audio APIs or even to try streaming approach, so I'm going to maybe do that bit just just to see like how, you know, the API is and how it matters, but I think the next thing I'm going to focus on will I'm going to focus on human intelligence like I said.\n\n@me: So I'm going to go ahead and back uh, back again and play a YouTube video just the final time.\n\n@me: Uh, and see if that gets recorded properly.\n\n@me: Uh, I'm going to go to a new section of this which is uh, design system import and fidelity.\n\n@me: What if you were a brand and you actually wanted to use your own type of design system that it's that's already existing in your brand?\n\n@me: We can take this as an example from Twix CN, this Northern Lights uh, design system over here, and we can go ahead and check to see how it looks like in light mode and dark mode.\n\n@me: But let's just say that this is like my business's design system and we can go ahead into the code and copy this code and let's go ahead and start from scratch with these two tools, right?\n\n@me: So I want to go ahead and create a signup flow again, but now I want to integrate this design system from my company.\n\n@me: So we're going to just go ahead and click on this to start and here in Figma you'd have to just say include this design system and paste in the code.\n\n@me: But over here in Magic Path what we can do is we can just click on this design system button up here, click on import, paste this code, click on apply and then all we have to do is just save the changes.\n\n@me: We can also preview light and dark mode, save the changes and we can name it like our business or something like that, click on save design system.\n\n@me: And then I'm going to scroll all the way back here after all this this code and get this, copy it.\n\n@me: Double click over here, paste the prompt and now I'm going to choose that design system from the dropdown which is all the way up here, our business.\n\n@me: And we're going to go ahead and generate both of these.\n\n@me: Now at first glance you can see that there is quite a difference between the two, the the difference is quite striking, right?\n\n@me: If I were to just open this up, as you can see some of the colors are there, but the primary colors aren't really there, they're black.\n\n@me: Um, they have there's they have this combination of black and like light blue, doesn't really look so nice.\n\n@me: It pretty much gives us the same type of design as the last one but these these letters overlap this, so it's kind of like they have these this text down here and this text up here.\n\n@me: So it's kind of I think confused the AI a bit, but as you can see in Magic Path if I were to increase this screen over here, you can see that we have the not only do we have the colors and all that, but we also have the exact font that this design system uses.\n\n@me: Now another thing that is um, that I want to test with these two tools is the individual elements, editing individual elements, right?\n\n@me: Down here.\n\n@me: Okay.\n\n@me: Uh, what's trying for sure, Figma Make and Magic Path, I'm going to do that.\n\n@me: And now I'm going to end the recording and I really really really look forward to a brilliantly done transcript.\n\n@me: Thank you so much.\n\n@me: 909.\n\n@speaker1: going back here, we do have a few presets.\n\n@speaker1: We have the signup flow, we have a data dashboard, we have a grading gallery.\n\n@speaker1: So, and if we click over here, if we click on one of these components and ask Magic Path, we also get a few presets.\n\n@speaker1: And if I click over here on the left, signup flow, we get design a user-friendly signup flow for a website that aims to provide an effortless onboarding experience for new users.\n\n@speaker1: And it basically gives us like some other details.\n\n@speaker1: And what I want to do is I'm just going to copy this and I'm going to go ahead and basically send this here and I'm going to do the same thing over here, right?\n\n@speaker1: Click on send and in the Figma Make view you get this code view of, you know, the code being created.\n\n@speaker1: You know, coming from a designer's perspective you don't really understand this or maybe most of the of the designers won't really understand this.\n\n@speaker1: But in the Magic Path view you actually get like a streamed like a live streaming process of how the design is being built with the AI.\n\n@speaker1: And as the design gets closer to completion, you can start seeing more and more elements get visually added to the to the canvas rather than with code.\n\n@speaker1: Now as the two are basically finished generating, we can go ahead and stretch out the Figma Make one.\n\n@speaker1: And Figma Make gives us a nice design with the uh, with a transition with these different images on the left.\n\n@speaker1: We have a text down here and then we have the flow on the right and with Magic Path I can go ahead and select this and I can move the breakpoints, right?\n\n@speaker1: So we can make it a little bit thicker, uh, wider, sorry, not thicker.\n\n@speaker1: Uh, we can make it thinner to kind of get like a mobile view and we have this very flexible way of interacting with our creations.\n\n@speaker1: And as you can see we also have a very similar type of design transition with the images, but we have an additional little interactive element down here that kind of shows us the speed of when the image will be transitioned to the next one.\n\n@speaker1: Another thing to realize is that\n\n@speaker1: what if you were a brand and you actually wanted to use your own type of design system that it's that's already existing in your brand?\n\n@speaker1: We can take this as an example from Twix CN, this
