  "transcript": "@me: I am on my own. Just wanna test how we doing. I think we're doing pretty fine right now except the moment. I'm gonna let our speaker identification issue. So there's a noise in the AirPods. Maybe you should. I wanna watch this. Let's go ahead. Okay. That's great. The guy is on I think I'm gonna go ahead and finish the TED talk. So I'm gonna do that. The first thing is I'm gonna take off my AirPods, but I will continue to speak. I hope it's still me as me. Alrighty. I'm still speaking. Oh, and I wanna go back to listening to that podcast. So that podcast actually is a TED talk by this guy called He's a Kickstarter founder, Yancey we're talking about art without the artist. And we have some things to talk about. Let's see.\n\n@speaker1: I'm the son of a musician, and my career began writing about music for Pitchfork and Village Voice. I started a tiny record label, and I'm one of the cofounders of Kickstarter, which gave creative people a way to bypass the gatekeepers and go straight to the public with the projects. Before Kickstarter, so many amazing projects had no chance to exist because they didn't fit some preexisting business model. After Kickstarter, millions of people have exchanged billions of dollars in support of new ideas. Where there was a wall, we built a door. But despite what you hear about the greater economy, the reality for most creative people is stark. It's estimated that 80 five percent of visual artists make less than 20 five thousand dollars a year, And that's just 13 of creative people earn full time living from their work. So we're not talking about aristocrats and rock stars. We're talking about people working hard trying to make a living by doing what comes natural to them. A musician, a craftsperson, a community theater director, a potter. Millions of people who are our friends, our family, our neighbors who inspire us and millions more people too. But despite being so central to how we experience life, we don't make things easier than these folks. There's no automatic health care. There's no retirement benefits. There's no path to collective wealth at all. They're entirely on their own. In a world of global capitalism, creative people operate like eighteenth century traveling pebbles, moving from village to village and project to project, trying to piece together a rhythm. So there's something missing here. A way for creative people to get access to the basics and be a part of something bigger than just them on their own. And I personally really struggled with this a few years ago. I was grinding away in the creator economy and getting lonelier by the second. The people most like me were my biggest competition. It left me constantly on edge and burnt out and alone. Eventually, I got so frustrated, I started a new project to help creative people release work together. It's called Metallabel. And one of the first releases was by myself and 10 other writers who'd all independently written about the same subject. So I reached out to these people who I didn't know, and I proposed a way that we would work together. We would publish our pieces together in a book, and the initial sales would go back to paying the cost of making it. After that, 70% of the profits would be split equally among us, and 30% would go into a shared treasury that we could use for a future project if things went well. Everyone agreed, and we became the Dark Forest Collective. And now a year later, we've sold 2,000 copies of this book. More than $70,000 has automatically flowed through our arrangement. And just now, we published our second book by another author, even better than the first. And our little collective is gonna make six figures, which is wild. But then I realized it was kinda silly to be so legally YOLO about this, and so I should create some sort of structure to represent what we were doing. I was surprised to find there wasn't an obvious fit. We could be an LLC, but that just puts a shield over the project. It doesn't help you grow the pie or share it. We could be a c corporation, but then you're taxed twice and you have all sorts of overhead. You could be a nonprofit and then be wrapped in red tape. So I started thinking, what if you could create a new structure for a project like ours? So I reached out to a trusted colleague, and soon, we were speaking to experts in making new corporate forms. And for the last year, a small team of us have been working together digging into this question. And I'm here representing our work because we've come up with something, a new structure for creative work. We call it the artist corporation or a corp. Now I realize that a new corporate structure sounds like the last thing creative people need, and that these two words are the exact opposite of each other. But the a corp just might be the door that opens up a new path to prosperity for creative people. You can think of an a corp as like a company but built for how creative people work. And we can imagine a band starts, and right from the beginning, they have an a corp. So not just five individuals, they're people who collectively own an organization that has the power to own their intellectual property, their gear, their business. As they start to get paid, that money can automatically flow to each of the members according to preset amounts, and they could even set aside money to be saved for future projects in the treasury or pooling together with other artist corporations to get better health care or other benefits. As an artist corporation, they would also be able to receive both commercial revenue as well as nonprofit sources of funding. And if a label or a bigger commercial entity came along, rather than just selling the rights to their intellectual property, which has been customary until now, as an artist corporation, they can issue shares. So instead, instead, that entity would make an investment in the artist corporation, allowing it to be valued more highly and everyone to benefit the state as well. Now these are simple simple things things for for many many businesses to do, but they're very hard for creative people to do. But artist corporations will take these same capabilities and put them in the hands of the entire creative community. And creative people are already leaders and entrepreneurs who just don't think of them that way. The painter Mike Kelly once said, I started out an anarchist and a hippie, and now I'm an entrepreneur with 15 employees. Look at Tyler the creator, teenage hip hop phenom turned fashion impresario and now world builder. Or Dolly Parton, who turned her incredible talent and fame into a whole world of businesses and even a theme park that celebrates where she comes from in the Smoky Mountains of Tennessee. Now these are people at the top of their game who use their agency to take these bigger risks. But what if you didn't have to be in the one percent to get that chance? What if these sort of tools and self determination were part of every artist's kid? So this is not a government handout. This is not a charity. This is not a special favor. This is the exact opposite. Right now, creative people are excluded from the full benefits of capitalism. Artist corporations will treat them as real economic actors for the first time. Pretty inconsistent structure for how we value creative work is gonna cause a revolution in how these industries operate, and it's gonna bring more money into the space we've ever seen before. A lot of it coming from fans who just wanna support the world they wanna see and won't be looking for a big financial return. Other people will. And I fully expect venture capital for artists and creators to become a real thing. And to be honest, this is where I start to get nervous. But then I remember the way things are now. To make this a reality, we're following an established path for making new corporate forms, and we have people on our team who've successfully done this before. A lot of this work will be happening in public, building a coalition of artists, creators, fans, investors, politicians, all people who believe that artist corporations are a good thing for everybody. Because this isn't anti tech. This isn't anti AI. This is about what type of world we wanna live in. One where we rent access to corporate controlled AI generated platforms, or one where our creative and cultural institutions are owned by the people who make them. If we keep artists powerless, the options are just gonna get more and more limited. But if we allow them to be more than just individuals, only possibilities will. That changes how the rest of us see the world. Artists don't need pity. Artists need power. And together, we're gonna build it. Thank you.",
