Opening
It was the three of them: the team lead, Sarah (designer), and Mike (developer), on a quick three‑minute check‑in about user onboarding. The tone was brisk and a little worried in a practical way—the team lead set it up as something to “figure out,” and there was an audible sigh once the problem clarified.

Key discussion points
- The drop‑off: Sarah surfaced the headline number—about 40% of users aren’t completing signup—and pointed to step 3 as the friction point. The verification email is confusing: people don’t see it, or don’t know what to do when they do. Mike, joining a bit late and apologetic about traffic, backed this up with support tickets from the past week asking where the email went.
- The email itself: Sarah noted the current template “looks like spam,” which likely compounds the issue when users do find it. Mike said he could take on a redesign and would want to test multiple versions.
- Guidance on the page: To address delivery and expectation‑setting, Sarah suggested clearer on‑page messaging—explicitly telling users to check their inbox and spam folder. The team lead asked for a same‑day mock.

Decisions and agreements
They agreed the priority is step 3. Two tracks: improve the email experience (template redesign with A/B testing) and add clearer on‑page guidance around the verification email. Sarah will mock the page messaging today. Mike will deliver a redesigned email template and run A/B tests, aiming for Friday. The team closed quickly with no further topics.

Action items
- Sarah: Mock up on‑page messaging about the verification email (including a prompt to check spam) by end of day today.
- Mike: Redesign the verification email template and set up A/B tests; target delivery by Friday.
- Team lead: Follow up tomorrow, per the closing.
