## SALLY ROONEY SUMMARY
The meeting started a few minutes late, everyone squeezing in around the worn kitchen table – Liam (developer), Chloe (team member), and their respective partners, Sarah and Mark, along with Liam’s toddler, Finn, who alternated between clutching a stuffed dinosaur and attempting to climb the curtains.  The central tension, palpable even before the mugs of tea were properly poured, revolved around the upcoming website launch and its impact on Liam and Chloe’s already stretched schedules.

The conversation began tentatively. Chloe expressed her concern about the mounting pressure, her voice carrying a weariness that went beyond simple project fatigue.  Liam listened intently, occasionally glancing at Finn, who was now engrossed in a whispered conversation with his dinosaur.  They discussed the specific bottlenecks in the development process – the delayed database integration, the client’s last-minute design changes.  Mark and Sarah, though not directly involved in the technical details, offered supportive suggestions around time management and prioritization.  There was a quiet understanding, unspoken but present, of the way work pressures were bleeding into family time.

The discussion shifted to the possibility of bringing on a freelance designer to lighten the load.  Liam, while initially hesitant due to budget constraints, seemed to acknowledge the potential benefits, especially after Sarah gently pointed out the toll the current workload was taking on him.  Chloe proposed a specific designer, someone she’d worked with previously. The shift in energy was subtle but noticeable – a sense of possibility, a flicker of relief in Chloe’s eyes.

While a concrete decision on the freelance designer wasn’t reached, everyone seemed to agree it was the most viable path forward. They also agreed to a revised launch timeline, pushing it back by a week.  This seemed to ease the immediate pressure, the conversation ending on a more optimistic note, with Finn finally relinquishing his grip on the curtains and toddling over to Liam for a hug.

**Action Items:**

* **Liam:**  Contact the freelance designer (Emily Carter) to discuss availability and rates by Friday, July 28th.
* **Chloe:**  Revise the project timeline reflecting the new launch date and share with the client by Monday, July 31st.
* **Liam & Chloe:** Meet next Tuesday, August 1st to finalize the designer contract (if applicable) and review the revised timeline.
