# audio mixing implementation decision

## goal
single, perfectly synchronized audio file for accurate transcription (gemini/whisper) with both mic and system audio mixed together.

## critical requirements
- **perfect sync**: no drift between mic and system audio
- **no content loss**: every word must be captured
- **transcription accuracy**: output must be suitable for ai transcription
- **reliability**: must work consistently for 1-3 hour meetings

## three approaches evaluated

### approach 1: real-time avaudioengine mixing
```
screencapture → convert → playernode → mixernode → single file
mic input ────────────────────────→ mixernode → single file
```

**pros:**
- single file output immediately
- avaudioengine handles mixing

**cons:**
- format conversion complexity (mono mic + stereo system)
- potential timing drift over long recordings
- scheduling buffers with correct pts complex
- risk of audio glitches if scheduling isn't perfect

**complexity:** medium-high
**risk:** moderate - timing issues possible

### approach 2: ring buffer architecture
```
screencapture → ring buffer → custom mixer → file
mic input ───────────────────────────────→ file
```

**pros:**
- full control over mixing
- handles thread boundaries well

**cons:**
- complex implementation
- manual sync management
- custom mixing code needed
- high risk of bugs

**complexity:** high
**risk:** high - many moving parts

### approach 3: two files + automatic ffmpeg mixing ✅ **chosen**
```
screencapture → system_[timestamp].wav
mic input ────→ mic_[timestamp].wav
post-process: ffmpeg -filter_complex amix → mixed_[timestamp].wav
```

**pros:**
- dead simple implementation
- no sync issues (each stream records independently)
- perfect for transcription after mixing
- debugging easy (can inspect each file)
- fallback safety (both files available if mixing fails)
- proven approach (obs, screenflow use this)

**cons:**
- requires ffmpeg (bundled with app)
- ~2 second post-processing after recording

**complexity:** low
**risk:** minimal

## our decision: approach 3

we chose two files + automatic ffmpeg mixing because:

1. **simplicity wins**: least code, least bugs
2. **reliability proven**: used by professional tools
3. **perfect sync guaranteed**: both streams use same system clock
4. **transcription ready**: single mixed file for ai services
5. **fast implementation**: can ship today

## synchronization strategy

### timestamp alignment
```swift
// when recording starts
let sharedStartTime = Date()  // or mach_absolute_time() for microsecond precision

// mic recording starts
startMicRecording()
micStartTime = sharedStartTime

// system audio starts (may have ~50ms delay from permission)
startSystemRecording()
systemStartTime = sharedStartTime + measuredDelay

// filenames include timestamp
let timestamp = Int(sharedStartTime.timeIntervalSince1970)
"mic_\(timestamp).wav"
"system_\(timestamp).wav"
```

### handling startup delay
```bash
# if system audio has 50ms delay, align in ffmpeg
ffmpeg -i mic.wav -i system.wav -itsoffset 0.050 \
  -filter_complex "[0:a][1:a]amix=inputs=2:duration=longest[out]" \
  -map "[out]" mixed.wav
```

### critical sync points
1. **shared clock source**: both use mach_absolute_time()
2. **warmup handling**: both discard first 500ms (already implemented)
3. **file headers**: store exact start time in metadata
4. **sample-accurate alignment**: ffmpeg handles sub-frame alignment

## implementation checklist

- [ ] add system audio file writer to screencapturemanager
- [ ] ensure both files use same timestamp in filename
- [ ] store precise start times for both streams
- [ ] measure actual delay between mic and system start
- [ ] implement automatic ffmpeg mixing on stop
- [ ] verify mixed output has both streams aligned
- [ ] test with 30+ minute recordings for drift

## expected quality

### sync accuracy
- **initial alignment**: within 50ms (one video frame)
- **drift over 1 hour**: < 1ms (using system clock)
- **transcription impact**: negligible (human speech ~200ms phonemes)

### comparison to electron issues
| aspect | electron (web) | native (swift) |
|--------|---------------|----------------|
| timing precision | ~16ms (js) | <1ms (coreaudio) |
| clock source | multiple | single system clock |
| startup delay | 100-500ms variable | 50ms consistent |
| drift over time | accumulates | none (same clock) |
| api layers | 4-5 layers | direct hardware |

## ffmpeg mixing command

```bash
# basic mix with auto-levels
ffmpeg -i mic.wav -i system.wav \
  -filter_complex "[0:a][1:a]amix=inputs=2:duration=longest:dropout_transition=2[out]" \
  -map "[out]" \
  -ac 2 -ar 48000 \
  mixed.wav

# with level adjustment if needed
ffmpeg -i mic.wav -i system.wav \
  -filter_complex "[0:a]volume=1.5[mic];[1:a]volume=0.8[sys];[mic][sys]amix=inputs=2[out]" \
  -map "[out]" \
  mixed.wav
```

## conclusion

two files + automatic ffmpeg mixing provides:
- **perfect sync** via shared timestamps
- **100% reliability** (simple = reliable)
- **transcription ready** output
- **fast implementation** (~200 lines vs ~1000)

this approach has been proven by obs, screenflow, and audio hijack. it's the right balance of simplicity and quality for ai&i.
