# claude development guidelines

## style
- user-facing text in lowercase: app names, git commits, docs, research, ui text
- code follows swift conventions (camelCase for properties, etc)
- add comments and details as much as possible (even when not requested)

## xcode console access
- view → debug area → activate console (⌘+shift+y)
- or click console button in bottom toolbar
- or view → debug area → show debug area
