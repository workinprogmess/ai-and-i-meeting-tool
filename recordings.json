main tere se baat kar raha hu aur idhar for instance mera slack khula hai ya if i'm reading something ya if i'm doing something ya mera koi aur cheez khuli hai let's say ray wali chat khuli hai so it

karega\"\n(asking for counterargument, a concerned point raised)\n\n[4:50] @speaker1: \"i think i don't think i have an answer i have an answer to this and kind of like sometimes i feel that it helps

profiles hain jaise tere pass hain\"\n(responding to the concern with a measured response, providing additional context)\n\n\n[5:00] @speaker1: \"ai meri ek profile hai ai ek profile hai write ek

khuli hai much easier for me to\"\n(further contextualizing, explaining the advantage)\n\n[5:15] @speaker2: \"i think personal work ke liye better hai par office mein yeh distraction create karta hai\"\n(expressing agreement for personal work but disagreement for office work, continuing the discussion)\n\n\n[5:20] @speaker1: \"i don't know uh may be\"\n(conceding that there are nuances, not

@speaker1: \"okay but anyways iski toh bahut formatting honi hai abhi isi liye toh main bol raha hu na this is only for me test version hai yeh abhi yeh basic jo tune yeh dhancha tereko dikh raha hai minimal sa it's because i wanted to focus less on design and more on functionality but jaise jaise meri functionality thodi si stable ho rahi hai toh i need to work on design\"\n(explaining prioritization, showing rationale and a logical workflow)\n\n[6:40] @speaker2: \"yeh hindi ko bhi lelena hai\"\n(raising a new point, slightly concerned)\n\n[6:45] @speaker1: \"yes jaise ki main dikhaata hu yeh kuch abhi maine hamari wali bhi ek do kari hai i think chat gpt aur jeman dono hindi mein bhi kaafi comfortable hai yeah jaise yeh dekh ismein dekh mujhe lag raha hai ki\"\n(affirming and explaining, providing reassurance and showing examples)\n\n[6:50] @speaker1: \"play wale main thoda i like this play wale ko connect karta hu is isse baad card pe tap karo toh woh play wala\"\n(explaining a design element, using simple language)\n\n[6:55] @speaker1: \"abhi 16 16 hai upar se jo tune bola hoga 16 16 thoda sa is card ko bada kar do so that 48 ko bhi card ko bhi sabko thodi thodi space mil jaye\"\n(providing specific design feedback, making the request simple and clear)\n\n[7:00] @speaker2: \"kaafi precise hai\"\n(positive feedback, showing

that's kind of thing use name mein woh aap shuruat mein at the rate yeah at the rate username aayega yaha par like kuch meetings mein dikha deta hai usmein phir thoda sa ek buggy hai kuch meetings mein dikhayi jaise yeh at the rate v aa raha hai but yeh\"\n(highlighting a bug and its intermittent appearance)\n\n[7:10] @speaker2: \"selling kaise hoga\"\n(asking a question about future plans)\n\n[7:15] @speaker1: \"uh selling toh jyada difficult uh nahin hai i mean like pehle toh mereko uh selling se pehle na mujhe product ko thoda sa sahi karna hai in the sense like matlab like bigger selling pehle so right now what i'm doing is i'm gonna matlab yeh thoda sa is weekend tak stabilize ho jana chahiye mujhe lagta hai toh what i want to do is i will reach out to 10 20 founders on twitter jo may be granola use karte hain ya meeting app use karte hain jinkr baare mein baat karte hi rahte hain log anyway\"\n(explaining the selling strategy, conveying a logical workflow)\n\n[8:00-9:00] @speaker1 details his _go-to-market strategy_ focusing on _early adopters_. 🔵\ndiscussing his plan, focusing on acquiring a small number of loyal users first.\n\n[8:00] @speaker1: \"toh i'll just ping them aur jo ek do founders let's say do char panch founders se main thoda touch mein hu so i'm gonna just ask them ki hey i'm building this uh give this a try uh and obviously some will say no i'm good with this i don't this is not my problem etc that's fine so basically kuch reach out karke i will try ki mere pass 10 15 mere beta users ho jaye who who think jo main problem solve karne ka try kar raha hu with different kind of summaries human summaries and making meetings a little bit more human in the sense and more connected uh toh woh unki bhi problem ho\"\n(detailing the strategy, showing understanding of market dynamics)\n\n[8:10] @speaker1: \"jo ki maine search kiya hai there is a lot of people who feel that meeting notes are bland kuch toh milta nahi hai unse aadi cheezein yeah feel toh aati nahin hai usmein toh toh feel lane ke liye aap uh basically some people are thinking about this is a problem so i'll see like if people would relate yes i think easy to find those people and then you know like just uh sort of uh learn from their feedback may be ek hafta do hafta unke sath kaam kar ke to see like what the idea is that those 10 15 people actually become mad loyalist like they feel like man this is the product this this this really solves my problem\"\n(providing additional context, explaining strategy)\n\n\n[9:00-10:00] @speaker1 discusses _scaling_ and _investor needs_. 🟠\nfocus shifts to long-term plans, showing slight concern and cautious optimism.\n\n[9:00] @speaker1: \"so if because if that happens then those 10 15 people would bring another 10 15 people or 20 people or whatever that is and if they also like it and if they really like it then those 20 people will bring another 20 30 40 people and ek do unme se koi influencer hoga kisi ki jyada following hogi kuch hoga jo thoda sa jyada impact create karega so i don't want like rush like quickly mere pass 100 users aa jaye because usse aap learn nahin kar pate and it's very important to have people who are mad about your product at least the first hundred people should be really really crazy about your product before you really go to more and more people otherwise imagine you have like 500 users may be woh aapko pay kar rahe hain but they are like average uh they are not in love with your product they will lose they will they will give up and they will not talk about it they will not go gaga about your product on twitter jaise log granola ke baare mein notion ke baare mein ya you know like aajkal ki kuch kuch cheezein jo nahin aa rahi hain product jaise abhi aajkal yeh google ka jo image product aaya hai\"\n(explaining the importance of building a loyal base, showing understanding of market dynamics)\n\n[9:10] @speaker1: \"so so so how do you how do you do that that is the most important thing agar woh ho gaya na like first 30 40 50 60 people who are so in love by from there going to 3000 is much easier first 300 and then 3000 so toh aapko toh investor ki jarurat hi nahin padegi\"\n(reiterating the key point, answering the previous question)\n\n[9:15] @speaker1: \"i think so i'm not really thinking about investors at least right now i think it should be a very very profitable business probably like 80% gross margin pe operate karna chahiye main may be let's say agar thoda sa kuch power users honge woh jyada use karenge toh may be like 50 60% toh agar main jitna paisa kama raha hu usse main shayad aadha paisa kharch kar raha hu so that that should be the math ultimately should come out toh ideally should not be but uh scale karna hota hai aapko toh toh but i'm not thinking about scale right now i just want\"\n(explaining financial projections, emphasizing profitability and organic growth)\n\n[9:25] @speaker2: \"scale karne mein kya issue hai aapko bas cloud space chahiye hoga woh toh phir aap aa hi sakte hain na\"\n(raising a question about scaling, identifying a key challenge)\n\n[9:30] @speaker1: \"nahi yaar i mean like actually it's not just that matlab woh phir alag level ki problem aati hai when you are thinking about 100000 users one million users it requires marketing not just because organic se aap ek level tak hi pahunch pate ho organic ka jo growth rate bhi hota hai woh bhi thoda sa slow hota hai but i can burn money i can spend on influencer marketing i can spend on all kinds of other form of marketing to have more and more people using my product i can work on all kind of other strategies going on podcasts doing this putting down granola saying my product is so much better then invest in my own podcast matlab all kinds of growth growth tactics aap karte ho then product ko bhi aap phir us level ka enhance karte ho enterprise ke liye bhi ready karte ho ki bilkul enterprise mein main jau ek contract se hi mujhe seedha 100000 dollar mil jaye toh phir aap us point of view se bhi product ko ready karte ho ab product ko ready karne ke liye phir aapko team chahiye aur enterprise sales karne ke liye sales team chahiye toh when you start thinking about all those things then you know\"\n(explaining the complexity of scaling, outlining the marketing and team building requirements)\n\n[9:40] @speaker2: \"i think retirement plan ke liye thoda chhota base 1000 do 3000\"\n(raising a concern, expressing a different viewpoint)\n\n[9:45] @speaker1: \"oh yeah see think about it think about it thoda chhota toh think about that that's what i'm thinking about right now imagine i have 1000 paying users toh sochke dekh ek baari ke liye and i'm not even thinking really big 1000 paying users achievable number in the next whatever time six months one year whatever now 1000 paying users let's say if i charge 25 dollars a month which is the lowest in this category that's 25000 dollars a month jis mein se maan le agar main jis mein se maan le agar main 10000 dollar kharch bhi kar raha hu har mahine ke i still am making like 15000 dollars abhi main thoda mota mota math bata raha hu\"\n(explaining financial projections, emphasizing profitability)\n\n\n[10:00-11:00]  @speaker1 clarifies his _long-term goals_ and _reason for moving to the US_. 🟢\nclarifying his perspective; achieving a sense of resolution.\n\n[10:00] @speaker2: \"phir toh aapko us bhi jaane ki jarurat nahin padegi\"\n(expressing a point of view)\n\n[10:05] @speaker1: \"yaar woh mujhe isliye nahin jaana hai ki kyunki main paise nahin kama sakta paise toh main kama sakta hu woh mujhe isliye jaana hai kyunki mujhe sikhna hai i want to be friends with sam altman i want to be friends with all those investors right because they are operating at a very different level the picture jo duniya ki picture woh dekh rahe hain aur jo main dekh raha hu\"\n(clarifying his motivations, expressing a personal goal)\n\n[10:10] @speaker2: \"matlab aapka divorce na kara de\"\n(expressing a light-hearted concern)\n\n[10:15] @speaker1: \"kyun karayega yaar woh toh badhiya banda hai\"\n(responding to the concern, showing confidence)\n\n[10:20] @speaker1: \"what i mean is like woh is a very different problem jiske liye main waha jaana chahta hu paise toh main yaha baitha baitha kama sakta hu mereko woh problem nahi hai meri\"\n(clarifying his reasons, emphasizing his professional goal)\n\n\n[11:00-12:00] @speaker1 explains the _current state_ of the application and

the this is basically the thing right now abhi yaha par meetings hai yeh summary yeh transcript hai yeh summary hai bahut bahut basic formatting hai obviously isko neat karna hai sab kuch karna hai is window ko thoda sa banana hai abhi koi sign in nahi hai koi kuch nahi hai toh woh lekar aana hai uh koi settings nahi hai woh lekar aana hai toh basically wahi cheez hai toh granola se na tereko kya cheez dekhni hai because woh finished product hai it works right i'm not worried about woh summary kaise karta hai because uske liye woh mera wahi toh differentiation hai\"\n(explaining the current state, focusing on the core aspects)\n\n[11:10] @speaker2: \"koi aur meri summary hai\"\n(raising a question about the summarization method)\n\n[11:15] @speaker1: \"haan flow dekhna hai ui dekhna hai aesthetics dekhna hai uh uh kaha par kya hai kitna spacing kitna woh tujhe bass usko bahut ache se understand aur study karna hai so that hum kuch kuch cheezein yaha le lein so mujhe na kya karna hai ki mereko interface ko reinvent nahin karna hai right mujhe product ki quality improve karni hai jo aapko mil raha hai which is meeting notes\"\n(explaining what to focus on in terms of improvements,

and the context of comparison; showing resolution.\n\n[11:20] @speaker2: \"granola wale kyun nahin kar pa rahe isko\"\n(raising a question about a competitor)\n\n[11:25] @speaker1: \"yaar it's not about granola wale kyun nahin kar pa rahe hain it's about obviously they can also do it because it's a prompt main bhi prompt kar raha hu woh bhi ai ko prompt kar rahe hain dono kar sakte hain but it's about ki aap konsi problem solve kar rahe ho they are fine they are fine not doing it otter bhi nahin kar raha otter toh granola se bhi bahut badi company hai otter ne toh 100 million dollar raise kare hue hai\"\n(explaining the reasons, showcasing strong reasoning and differentiation)\n\n\n[12:00-13:00] @speaker1 uses _Google Docs_ and _Notion_ as examples to explain his _product vision_. 🟢\ndetailed example used to explain the unique positioning of the application; resolution achieved.\n\n[12:00] @speaker1: \"otter toh shittiest product dekhna na matlab it's like feature se bhara pada itna messy itna potty product hai but see this is the thing you have to understand that like for instance google docs tha right google docs tha google docs abhi bhi hai but then notion aaya notion ne kaha ki main document likhna aur banane ko itna simple itna aasan aur itna creative aur itna beautiful kar dunga that it will be like makhan at the same time google docs mein document ko manage karna like ek page idhar ek page idhar ek page unhone nested bana diya ki page ke andar hi page ke andar hi page ke andar hi page is like ek jagah par cheezein automatically organized hone lag jaye at the same time it's so very easy and convenient to design to to to use a doc or something ab google docs bhi kar sakta tha unke pass paise hain engineers hain sab hain but it's about what is the frame of reference you are going with what problem you are solving is this your focus area is this or not that is why startups disrupt badi companies\"\n(explanation of his vision, putting it in the right context)\n\n[12:15] @speaker1: \"slack aaya itne saare products the phir bhi slack aaya became such a big company and now slack has become a incumbent ki people are now disrupting with ai they are building their own newer version of slack with ai at the core toh that is that is the beauty of the technology right you can take a problem solve it so very well that may be you can challenge a bigger company that's the beauty so it's not about they can't do it problem basically ab ek tarike se problem solve ho rahi hai convenience jyada provide kiya ja raha hai yes bilkul sahi baat hai toh it's just about that but anyway meri problem i honestly not thinking about jaise main tereko bol raha hu i don't want to replace granola or anything please become big company i just want a small niche i just want to serve thousand two thousand users and i'm fine with that\"\n(explanation of his vision and market strategy, emphasizing long-term view)\n\n\n[12:30-13:30]  @speaker1 discusses _future expansion_ into other markets. 🟡\nshifts focus to future expansion, expressing optimism and excitement about his vision.\n\n[12:30] @speaker1: \"aur phir pata hai ek aur cheez abhi matlab the beauty about these things is application maan le maine ek chhoti si audience ke liye bana diya which is founders now the same product because humanness aur jo main cross meeting analysis bol raha hu ki ek meeting note aur dusri meeting note mein jo relationship hai woh abhi pata hi nahin lagta ek meeting note yaha pada hai dusra meeting note yaha pada hai dono mein koi relationship hi nahin dikhta hai but jab tu aur main baat karte hain hum ek design ke upar kitni meetings lete hain unse nikal ke kitni cheezein aati hain hume design ko kaise samjhna hai kaise dekhna hai kaise kya karna hai hamare to do's kya hain right but hamari meetings baat hi nahin karti hai na granola pe na kisi aur pe ab agar main yeh wali jo aspect hai yeh main therapist ki life pe apply kar du jo ek bacche ke sath ya ek ek ek adult ke sath series of meetings leta hai aur socho us adult ke insights ek sath banne lag jaye toh woh therapist ko kitna help karenge toh if you try to start applying those to different markets let's say from founders to therapist to coaches to sales people or whatever that is then you also further your market grows but again you don't have to like target every therapist again another 500 therapists another 10 lakh rupees another 500 coaches another 10 lakh so those kind of things you can do but all those are dreams but you first have to make it work for 50 people you have to really really win in fact 50 se pehle the first 10 people they have to really love your product that's the thing\"\n(explaining the potential for expansion, conveying optimism and a vision for the future)\n\n[13:00] @speaker2: \"toh mujhe notion kyun dekhna hai\"\n(raising question again)\n\n[13:05] @speaker1: \"notion isliye bhi dekhna hai because notion is a document app and this is also a document app and notion has really nailed documents though abhi notion bhi thoda sa cumbersome ho gaya hai and notion also does meeting notes now\"\n(explaining the comparison, showing strong reasoning)\n\n[13:10] @speaker2: \"main honestly na main kabhi notion ke sath itna comfortable ho hi nahin paya\"\n(expressing a personal opinion)\n\n[13:15] @speaker1: \"thik hai toh tu notion mat dekhna just check granola ek product ko ache se uski saari screens dekh lena lekin nahi nahi main notion dekh lunga par aise hi bata raha hu ki notion ka learning toh pata nahin matlab notion ki basic cheez toh main kar leta hu par jo uska jo complex database wala part hai na haan usmein toh mereko koi samajh hi nahin aata ki shuru kaha se kare\"\n(responding to concerns, offering alternatives)\n\n\n[13:20] @speaker1: \"thik hai but notion database is not the problem that we have to solve for this product because we are not doing databases in this product right toh notion only from a standpoint of again sidebar sidebar kis tarah se arranged hai unki document document ki hierarchy kya hai kya kya cheezein aap kar sakte ho if a long document kis tarah se woh organize hota hai even document ko bhi uh thoda sa uh uski bhi alag settings hai ki aap yeh wala font use kar sakte ho yeh wala kar sakte ho just just see like how and some of those things how it works because see

The mood was one of focused curiosity tempered with realistic concern about LLM limitations. @v analyzed  the capabilities of LLMs in _code generation and modification_, contrasting them with the approaches of skilled human software engineers.  They highlighted the significant challenge of LLMs maintaining accurate _mental models_ of a project, and underscored the problems of _context omission_ and _recency bias_.  @v identified these as obstacles hindering LLMs' ability to iteratively build robust and functional software solutions.  While acknowledging the current limitations, @v expressed optimism towards future improvements.  They envisioned a world of successful human-AI collaboration in software engineering, where LLMs would become valuable tools, but with the understanding that human oversight and intervention will remain essential for complex projects. The session concluded with a brief, inconclusive discussion of a tool or concept called \"zed,\" and a quick look at next-generation code editors. The key takeaway is the urgent need to improve LLM's ability to retain and manage contextual information.\n\n\n### part 5: advanced insights\n\n**the one key thing:** LLMs currently lack the ability to maintain accurate mental models of complex projects; this fundamentally limits their usefulness in genuine software engineering.\n\n**unresolved questions:** What is \"zed\"?

    "summary": "The meeting with the CTO to discuss the therapist app UI ran for 50 minutes and felt, at times, like several meetings happening at once.  Present were myself, the CTO, and Diddy (P. Diddy). The primary goal was to review the session prep screens.\n\nThe conversation started with the CTO explaining the logic behind the consultation card display.  It became clear that technical limitations around cloud access and data flow were impacting the intended UI.  The discussion became fragmented as Diddy’s daughter entered, shifting the energy of the room dramatically.  Multiple threads emerged, ranging from language detection glitches (with humorous results due to the multilingual environment), to Diddy's daughter interacting directly with the CTO and myself.  This created a warm, chaotic interlude where the focus inevitably drifted from the app.  The CTO, however, maintained an impressive degree of professionalism throughout.\n\nOnce the familial interruption subsided, we returned to the session prep screens.  We discussed the distinctions between session prep for Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT) and regular therapy, agreeing that these should be handled differently within the app.  There was a brief detour into the nuances of painless vs. painful vaccinations, initiated by Diddy, before refocusing on the consultation protocol display.  The CTO clarified that the content was static, drawn from the backend, and would appear empty if the relevant data was missing.\n\n**Decisions reached:**\n\n* Agreed that session prep for CPT and regular therapy require distinct UI flows.\n* Confirmed that consultation protocol is static and driven by backend data.\n\n**Action Items:**\n\n* **CTO:** Investigate alternative cloud solutions to address data access limitations impacting UI display of consultation card (Deadline: Next sprint planning).\n* **You:**  Document the specific differences required for CPT vs. regular therapy session prep flows (Deadline: End of week).\n* **CTO:** Confirm backend data requirements for populating consultation protocol and communicate any necessary adjustments (Deadline: End of week).\n",

    "transcriptB": "[00:00-00:02] @speaker1 initiates the meeting with a warm and casual introduction, setting a relaxed tone. 🔵\n\n[00:00] @speaker1: \"so, do you want to maybe give a really quick intro of yourself before we get started?\"\n(standard meeting opener, shows politeness and structure)\n\n[00:02-00:01:30] @speaker2 provides a brief introduction, mentioning his work on ai, particularly at openai, and expressing excitement about _reasoning_ and _agents_. 🟡\n\n[00:02] @speaker2: \"yeah sure. um so uh i'm and good to be here today. so um i have been working on this ai stuff for a few years uh and um i have at openai i've been mainly um focusing on o1 preview o1 and most recently deep research and now i'm more on the this agent side of things and so um yeah very excited about reasoning and uh agents and just those things um so\"\n(positive and enthusiastic, sets a positive tone for the technical discussion to follow)\n\n[00:01:30-00:05:00]  @speaker2 uses a _chatgpt-generated image_ of a budding flower as a metaphor to illustrate the challenge of perceiving slow, incremental change, especially regarding the rapid development of _ai_. 🔵🟠\n\n[00:01:30] @speaker2: \"okay great. um right let me get started. so uh i will talk about some ai stuff today obviously but before that let's actually um start looking at um let's see. right uh this chatgpt generated uh image of a flower a budding flower. if you stare at this um for like a minute or 10 minutes you don't really see any change. does that mean there is no change underlying this process. there is and if you wait long enough then you'll see some big changes to a full blown uh rose. and so what i'm trying to get at with this toy image is that we're really not good at um perceiving the changes that occur in you know like minute or like even the days or years but we're pretty good at the minute and hour scale changes. so i think there's probably a evolutionary explanation for this uh where if you can uh perceive the changes in um in the environment uh and the changes in minutes probably very helpful for survival and if you for like changes in over a year not so much. um so i think that probably uh is some some built in um uh the deficiency uh uh that we probably need to correct.\"\n(Thought-provoking analogy; introduces a key theme of underestimation of slow-moving changes in the face of rapid technological advancement.)\n\n\n[00:05:00-00:15:00] @speaker2 introduces the _concept of leverage_ as a central theme,  using examples from classical mechanics (lever), finance (capital), and software (code).  He explains that _AI_ acts as a new leverage mechanism. 🔵\n\n[00:05:00] @speaker2: \"so um why am i talking about this? i think um actually ai is a probably the the fastest moving technology of all time. even then it doesn't move in like minutes or hours it still moves over a few years timeframe or even decades. so um i think given this um deficiency i just talked about we might be underestimating the change especially the magnitude of the change uh this ai is bringing about. and so um i think at this point i don't have to convince that ai is important even a few years ago i start um my talk like that but now i think that's given but i do want to emphasize that maybe what everyone's thinking about how big of this change is uh is very different uh and if anything think we might be underestimating it and especially for um this ai which i'm gonna argue as a leverage mechanisms for uh individuals and humanity as a whole that aspect uh might be somewhat underestimated. i'll get into the details of what what i mean by that but let's build uh intuition slowly at a time starting with this key word leverage. so it's a very important concept and used in a somewhat um casual way informally and sometimes overloaded and and um depends on this context. uh especially in the silicon valley area this term is used a lot. i think this is such an important word that uh it's worth spending some time and building intuition around this. so uh for me the first encounter of this concept was probably this classical mechanics where uh we have this uh lever. so in this case let's think about this um try to uh put a some pressure force down on the left hand side on the screen and then as an output of that the the the we're kind of um lifting up that 1 kilogram uh mass on the right. so the lever if we enlarge this uh lever um and then we can actually um you know lift up heavier objects. so what this means is that the input downward force is the same but by increasing this leverage the output was increased by 3x. and so um this actually is a very general concept and i would like to um call out uh maybe this is my working definition of leverage it's a mechanism through which a small change or no change in input results in larger change or very large change in output. um and this is a very general thing and it's not just about the classical mechanics context that we just saw i think it can be applied to many other places. um and so this actually is a um you know very important concept and i you know we many people want to increase the output i want to um contribute more i want to generate more um then the first thing the most natural thing that comes to uh our mind uh is probably how do i work harder how can i increase my input um i want to like sleep less and um um you know things like that but i think that's there's a certain limit to it. instead the more important question is how do i increase the output without actually increasing the input or how can i disconnect the relationship between the input and the output or linear relationship between them and that is getting at uh to the core of this leverage mechanism and so what you're looking for there is um what leverage mechanism do i have and can i have and that's uh if you want to increase the output that's the question that we have to think about.\"\n\n\n[00:15:00-00:20:00] @speaker2 discusses three types of leverage identified by naval ravakant: _human labor_, _capital_, and _code/media_.  He provides examples of each, emphasizing the exponential potential of code and media. 🔵\n\n[00:15:00] @speaker2: \"and as a general concept many many um different ways of thinking about this leverage my personal favorite is by uh naval ravakant and from this um book actually i have it um you know in the and here i strongly recommend it so this is um uh not by his book but it's just a collection of uh many of his thoughts like uh tweets and so on. according to naval there are three uh types of uh leverage and human labor capital and code and media. so let's think about uh these things um uh individually. so first type is the human labor and this is the oldest type of uh leverage and and as such probably the most familiar one. and so as an example um let's think about a scenario where i want to build a pyramid without the leverage i will be building alone and that's probably quite difficult and with leverage i can hire uh thousands of human workers and so my input uh is probably the same or uh even less i don't don't have to work as much but the output is much higher because there are thousands of people working on this. so this is um kind of a uh the leverage type with the permission because i need to ask the permissions of these uh people and uh we still have this uh human labor as one of the main leverage mechanisms in the society. second type is the capital. so uh let's think about this um a scenario where i want to invest in a real estate uh that's worth a million dollar i only have 200k so i do borrow 800k from the bank and let's say i get lucky and this thing gets um doubled in valuation to 2 million um i it just doubled but my uh return is 800% or 500% but it just went up by like a lot more because i just borrowed more from it. um and so this is kind of the uh second type and i think it's more of a common common thing for uh 20th century and and so on. so third type is more recent uh thing especially more common in the the area which is the code and so more of a software type and so if i write a code for an app i build it and then there's one user who gets the value n um let's suppose that number is positive and while i'm sleeping one more user downloads it and installs it and gets another value n. so i'll put just double without me having to do any additional work. so it's possible because it's a software which is uh you know copied and pasted which is a very interesting nature of this and a lot of the recent value has been created uh leveraging that so and media is similar in that um let's say i uh give a lecture to 200 people um those people got some value again assuming that's uh positive i posted on youtube any additional view of the same lecture i don't have to do any work but somehow the value goes up and the limit is actually um uh pretty much endless. so that's the the new type of leverage too. in historically large wealth creation um utilize these forms of leverage and so um like the 20th centuries uh wealth a lot of them financial industries um leverage a lot of this capital leverage and then um recently especially in this um area tech companies have leveraged the fact that if you write a code the output can be multiplied pretty much indefinitely.\"\n\n\n[00:20:00-00:25:00] @speaker2 explains how the upside of leverage mechanisms can be competed away, illustrating this with examples from software and youtube. He argues that _AI_ is changing what's scarce, shifting the focus to creativity and curiosity.  🟠\n\n[00:20:00] @speaker2: \"and then um so those are the wealth creation mechanisms and if you look at the history of wealth um big wealth generated and you can probably identify such a leverage. so but then the upside of the leverage mechanism is also um competed away and so what i mean by that is if something is good then many people realize it and that's gonna be um uh competition. so if you start a company that is only leveraging this um the fact that it's a software doesn't leverage other technologies then it's probably much harder to uh succeed now compared to say 20 years ago or maybe um i'm less familiar with this but youtuber you want to become a youtuber now probably more difficult than um 10 years uh ago just based on the competition. so i what i'm trying to get at is um when this leverage mechanism is uh just became possible because of some technology much larger values and returns are possible then uh and then it's gonna be competed away. so i think it's a really important to think about what are the new leverage mechanisms that are becoming available.\"\n\n\n[00:25:00-00:30:00]  @speaker2 discusses how _AI_ is affecting learning and acting as a leverage mechanism, particularly in scientific research. He notes that while _AI_ makes learning easier, the scarce factor shifts to _motivation_ and _curiosity_. He also introduces the concept of _AI agents_ as a new leverage mechanism and explains their significance. 🔵🟡\n\n[00:25:00] @speaker2: \"and so um obviously i'm gonna argue that ai is the um relatively new one that is coming into the picture and it's slowly expanding its scope and reach. um so to from an individual levels to um you know groups of people and to the point where it can uh benefit uh entire humanity. so let's maybe start looking at this uh at an individual level. um i personally use ai or chatgpt for me is um it in a education context. so i um that's probably the biggest one for me and i think i spent a lot of time especially uh weekends uh just learning about new concepts and um asking now i think talk about this ai uh even hours and just learning about new things and so here just again if you think about leverage uh when i think about ai as in leverage uh this learning what what is an input and output the input is my time and effort to understand some concept that i don't understand and the output is the conceptual understanding happening uh in my brain and maybe also some knowledge but that's uh that's a important thing. so with the ai this given input results in um you know larger output. so let's say if i'm trying to um learn some specific things about a distributed system um then before this kind of a generative ai i would have to you know google this and then probably a wikipedia page which is typically not beginner friendly. so i'll be uh reading it then like don't understand and probably don't feel good and then i'll try to find a introductory course maybe and textbook but then i want only one concept out of this but i kind of have to build around the context like at least terminologies and that's very time consuming. now because the ai can uh contextualize everything i know and generate dynamically just the right amount of materials at the right difficulty i can uh much learn much easier. so i think that's the the the big uh lesson from the learning. so um what i'm saying is the barrier to learn in new area is like collapsing essentially. um this is good and you probably heard about this a lot but is this good just everywhere? i i think there's some uh we have to be careful and have a comprehensive look and then um when everything is um easier to learn people are learning everything then there is an opportunity cost of not learning is getting higher. um so as an extreme example if you don't use ai you just don't think about it at all and you just do your thing you're not lazy just doing your own thing and everyone else is just learning new things and uh getting better and um so on then you're kind of behind uh in the society. that's the opportunity cost of just you don't contribute to it but just because uh it's uh the the relatively um decided what the valuable skill is that's uh what's happening. so um yeah i think the in in this the society the valuable skill is um determined based on um the supply and demand and what is scarce um as opposed to an objective value it provides. so um i think one extreme example is a human vision um and it's uh from objective perspective this is a extremely complicated and advanced um feature and if you study the computer vision probably know that oh human vision is incredible like you sometimes recognize uh your friends or in a setting where probably is very difficult um and you got you sometimes get surprised. but this incredible um capability is so abundant um that it's uh having that doesn't help you excelling in the modern society. um and so i think um uh similarly just uh like scarcity is a very important um necessary condition for any uh highly valuable skill. so um and i often think about what are uh some great skills or opportunities to to have and often the good good um rule of thumb is uh whatever evolution did not teach equip us then um that's kind of the good starting point uh because if it did then everyone has it built into dna and that's probably not that uh scarce. so um that's kind of the yeah uh my this some implications of learning getting easier which is not probably not that uh obvious and so this acquisition of the new knowledge gets cheap the scarce factor is the this motivation to explore and curiosity is kind of the characteristics that probably will be more important so well i mean it has been always important but i think it's getting more and more um because the learning um cost is going down but not zero. so you still have to overcome this um barrier when learning a new concept is not something um that i would say everyone finds pleasing because you feel challenged and this cognitive um challenge is not um comfortable. and so to overcome that uh curiosity can be like i i know there's a pain but i need to get this because i'm so uh curious about it that's a really uh strong force. if you're not curious i think there's a way to kind of um have a correction mechanism um which is okay i i i'm gonna go through this short term pain but there will be a long term um rewards some fulfilling um things happening so if you build enough of this reward some psychological can uh get over it but but anyway uh broad more broadly technology changes what is scarce um just makes um and just being aware of the such changes um even if you're not directly contributing to it uh is um i think uh very important. so that's one uh learning affecting learning uh is one way ai is acting as a leverage the other maybe more um uh intuitive one is this uh ai agent uh this is probably the most um interesting research area in 2025 and many more. um so uh here ai agent is um kind of combining the uh the two types of leverage mechanisms that we uh saw before. first one's the human labor because ai agent is doing the work for you so that's kind of the human labor part uh as if you hired them and then the second part is um at least the the the current um ai agents are um you know software uh only and so you can kind of copy and paste if you want um 10 outputs 10 agents working together you just do it if you want 12 then just copy uh two more and you don't have to ask for the permission this permission less uh form of uh composite leverage mechanism that i think is uh quite profound if you think about it. um so i think that's gonna be um um main um source of uh wealth generation uh going forward and this thing is very new i think it's just got started. um i if you have used uh deep research that's um to me the most uh well functioning uh ai agent as of now uh there will be more probably but uh that's at least the the kind of the first working agent for me uh and so that increases my uh output by a lot and maybe probably many others too. so individuals are quite uh supercharged and this means um you know small teams consist of uh individuals um generating really big values that's becoming more and more common. so in the you might heard about the startups with like 10 people 20 people generating like hundreds of millions of dollars of revenue uh that probably is un uh just imaginable like 10 years ago but now still uncommon but uh we're seeing this and i think behind the scene uh it's more of a ai acting as a leverage and individuals are just generating a lot more um outputs. and so previously if you want to increase the output then you again you want to think about the leverage mechanism and after raising funds and whatever for capital leverage is out of question then you have to really think about this human labor leverage and hire more people but then uh human collaboration especially at larger scale has quite a bit of overhead um there's communication um you know just uh it's a very difficult uh problem um and maybe some people don't get along with uh other people and so just adding one person to say 100 person uh group doesn't mean the output goes up by 1%. it can even be um negative or uh can be anything. so um now with supercharged individuals this um overhead uh is becoming less favorable and maybe we'll see more and more of uh smaller teams generating um uh quite a bit of uh value and more of a companies might be of this size and obviously there will be big companies but this might be a more common thing.\"\n\n\n[00:30:00-00:31:00] @speaker1 makes a comment referencing a past class discussion on _AI singularity_, prompting @speaker2 to pause the recording before responding. 🔴\n\n[00:30:00] @speaker1: \"and i think so far this has been like an individual level and uh some implications of the group as a result. um i think there slowly uh again this is like a the the the flower analogy from the beginning this is a change that is very big but uh it's so slow that i think it's kind of an under uh estimated by many people and it's acting at the humanity's level. so let's think about uh this uh so if we think about the the this all of humans here um what is the the task or goals um we might have uh i think this there's no right answer but to me one of the most important things is to continue to generate um value and to thrive and so what is the most um sustainable engines of growth and um value creation uh there are many prob but for me the most sustainable engine is um scientific advances um discovering new knowledge and suddenly uh the like you know what you think about as a thought about as a non resource just becomes resource because now you have a new knowledge to leverage that um oil for example is just sticky uh liquid now you know how to do this uh burning this and thermodynamic understanding you can uh that's such a valuable resource um many instances like that.\"\n\n[00:31:00-00:32:30]  @speaker2 continues discussing _AI's role in accelerating scientific progress_, touching upon the increasing complexity of modern science and comparing Newtonian physics to quantum mechanics. 🔵\n\n[00:31:00] @speaker2: \"so um here um if we think about from historical perspective since the like 17th century or roughly that time scientific revolution uh the the wealth creation just um uh like really took off and uh like a hockey stick uh shape of uh economic metric um since then. um and back then it was there were probably a lot of low hanging fruits in terms of the scientific progress uh because if you're the first one to do science then probably there's a lot of easy things to do. uh i'm not saying everything was easy because there's other challenges given the context but still from an objective complexity perspective this is probably much easier than what is happening now. so advancing science in modern society is a lot more complicated. so maybe we can think about uh newtonian versus quantum mechanics or if you want to make a um you know advanced uh chip making advanced computer chips uh that is probably beyond any single uh human's uh capability way beyond that. so it's getting a lot more complicated and involves uh sometimes involves larger collaborations among people and more capital and so on and also in addition to this uh increasing complexity of the technologies studying technologies human intelligence is not growing uh it's i don't even know it's growing but it's kind of a stagnant compared to the rate at which the scientific complexity increases. so um these factors uh put together i think are kind of the uh bottlenecks in uh further advancing this um core mission of uh keep advancing scientific progress. so um we have done great job whenever just um bottleneck happens we find a way to get uh out of it and we build the tools to unblock ourselves from achieving the mission. this time i think we should do the same thing with the ai being this tool that will um be the most useful thing and maybe even better a superhuman in the research capabilities so that we can continue this uh scientific advances and i i think there are many purposes of ai but to me this is the most um important single most important purpose of it is to augment uh in continuing this uh grand mission of scientific advances.\"\n\n\n[00:32:30-00:33:30] @speaker2 summarizes his points again, focusing on the _input and output_ of human scientific effort, and how _AI_ can act as a leverage mechanism to overcome existing limitations (communication, collaboration). 🔵\n\n[00:32:30] @speaker2: \"so uh now again just from the perspective of the leverage uh let's think about the input and the output. the input is the collective human effort um scientists here and there uh just working together uh or like implicitly together uh and then the output is the scientific um you know this progress uh of all and so um what how can ai act as a leverage here um think i'm gonna mention like two different things. first one is um you know when um actually uh let's think about this uh we highly uh encourage being a specialist especially in the scientific community so it uh there are small number of people who have a specialized knowledge and they're kind of segregated in different even uh you know locations and communities and and so on. so it's hard to um collaborate uh you might not even know what is available option for collaboration across different uh expertise areas and so to me this uh if you think about this human knowledge and mental mental picture i have is a very sharp um in you know high high dimensional space and that's like here and there and just um there's so much uh space between them and i think ai is acting as a um kind of an envelope around this uh spiky uh space and connecting all these um you know the specialist knowledge and if you're familiar with the um optimization this is like the convex hull that's an envelope around this um sharp uh you know corners here and there and i think this is the um the the one of the roles of ai so this when i was uh working on the deep research this um wasn't really obvious but as i worked more and more and get more value out of it this is kind of the mental picture i started building and so um here i'm trying to get at this um human experts um very specialized but um their you know cooperation has uh communication physical separations all all these um uh overhead and this um ai is kind of making that much much um more uh uh you know efficient.\"\n\n\n[00:33:30-00:35:00] @speaker2 further expands on the idea of _AI_ connecting disparate areas of expertise, envisioning _AI_ as a tool for knowledge synthesis and acceleration of scientific progress.  He concludes by emphasizing the potential of _AI_ as a super-human research capability. 🟡\n\n[00:33:30] @speaker2: \"and so um what i'm what i think is uh might be happening already is uh because of those um separations um and not unable to cooperate in an efficient manner we might have a huge overhang of uh existing knowledge synthesis. so even with um you know just combining the existing knowledge we might be able to get a lot of value and maybe we can call that new knowledge and so those are the uh i think uh completely uncharted territory just because of how experts have uh grown and the communication bottlenecks of um uh many many people and so these are i think the low hanging fruits uh of ai you know acting as a leverage to advancing the science mission and but i don't think that's the that's enough uh we should probably go beyond and maybe just uh going forward uh we can expect advanced reasoning maybe even better than uh human scientists and then ability to generate new ideas and knowledge uh i think this is still rare and maybe i'm hearing some you know vague um uh anecdotes that these are possible um like o3 helping some scientists generating new ideas brainstorming partner but i think it can go a lot more than that and so i would expect that this kind of uh abilities emerge in the future generations of the model if not al already in there and once that happens this will be um you know just non stopping um research engine that have works all the time and then they can work together uh across humans and agents and so on. this will be the main um leverage factor going forward how ai can help help this uh mission of the scientific progress so um that's all i have today and i've talked about many different concepts but uh i think ai is just important thing everyone knows that but um i would invite you to think about is this um how big of a change am i um thinking about and uh is there a possibility that i might be underestimating uh that magnitude especially um now that you think about from a new form of leverage um i would invite you to think about this um yeah that's it thanks.\"\n\n[00:35:00-00:36:00] @speaker1 thanks @speaker2, and then makes an observation linking the presentation’s conclusion to the previous class discussion regarding the _AI singularity_.  She offers to share visual materials from the class to make the discussion more interactive. 🔵\n\n\n[00:35:00] @speaker1: \"thanks so much. um uh so your final point actually uh reminded me of something we talked about a couple weeks ago in the class called uh do you guys remember what it was called? uh we talked about the singularity and uh uh how ai intelligence uh will reach a level where uh they surpass human intel well you know obviously we're already at that point. um do you think it relates to uh concepts such as that?\"\n\n\n[00:36:00-00:36:30] @speaker2 pauses the recording, presumably to ensure the conversation remains off the record before continuing.  🔴",

This set the stage for the main theme of underestimation.\n- **leverage mechanisms:**  @speaker2 meticulously detailed three types of leverage (human labor, capital, and code/media), using illustrative examples and citing naval ravakant's work.  This served as a foundational framework for his subsequent arguments.\n- **ai's impact on learning:** @speaker2 shared a personal anecdote of using _ai_ for learning, showcasing how it lowers the barrier to knowledge acquisition. He stressed that while learning becomes easier, _motivation_ and _curiosity_ become the new scarce factors.\n- **ai agents as a new leverage mechanism:** @speaker2 introduced _ai agents_ as a novel leverage mechanism, highlighting their ability to combine the benefits of human labor and code, leading to exponential increases in output and potentially even surpassing human research capabilities.\n- **ai and scientific progress:** @speaker2 argued that _ai_ can play a pivotal role in accelerating scientific progress, addressing the increasing complexity of modern scientific endeavors and connecting disparate areas of expertise.  He envisioned _ai_ as a “research engine” working nonstop.\n- **concluding remarks:** @speaker2 emphasized the importance of considering the magnitude of ai’s transformative influence and the need to explore its broader implications.  @speaker1 linked the discussion back to their previous conversation about the _ai singularity_.\n\n**closing assessment:**\nthe meeting ended with a recap of key points, particularly emphasizing the potential of _ai_ as a leverage mechanism to accelerate scientific progress.  The conversation's energy remained high, and there's a clear indication of further discussion around the _ai singularity_.  no specific action items were identified.\n\n\n### part 5: advanced insights\n**the one key thing:**  ai is not just a technology but a powerful leverage mechanism that can exponentially accelerate scientific progress, despite the potential for this leverage to be competed away, underscoring the need to identify and harness new forms of leverage, such as _ai agents_.\n\n**unresolved questions:** the relationship between ai's accelerating progress and the concept of the technological singularity, particularly the question of whether we are already at that point or not.\n\n**memorable moments:** @speaker2's flower analogy effectively captured the often-missed slow-moving, yet potentially enormous impact of ai.\n\n**specific action items:** none explicitly stated.\n\n## speaker analysis\n**individual goals:** @speaker1 likely sought a clear and concise explanation of ai leverage mechanisms. @speaker2 aimed to present his perspective on ai's potential and its often-underestimated impact, particularly in science.\n**satisfaction levels:** both seemed satisfied;  @speaker1's final question about the singularity suggests a desire for further exploration of the topic.\n**power dynamics:** @speaker2 led the discussion, presenting a structured argument;  @speaker1 guided the conversation with some probing questions.\n**energy/mood:** enthusiastic and focused from @speaker2;  engaged and inquisitive from @speaker1.\n\n## emotional dynamics\nenthusiastic and focused from @speaker2;  engaged and inquisitive from @speaker1.\n\n### part 3: meeting classification",
