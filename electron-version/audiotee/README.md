# AudioTee.js

AudioTee.js captures your Mac's system audio output and emits it as PCM encoded chunks at regular intervals. It's a tiny Node.js wrapper around the underlying [AudioTee](https://github.com/makeusabrew/audiotee) swift binary, which is [bundled](./bin) in this repository and distributed with the package published to [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/audiotee).

## About

[AudioTee](https://github.com/makeusabrew/audiotee) is a standalone swift binary which uses the [Core Audio taps](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coreaudio/capturing-system-audio-with-core-audio-taps) API introduced in macOS 14.2 to 'tap' whatever's playing through your speakers and emit it to `stdout`. AudioTee.js spawns that binary as a child process and forwards stdout as `data` events.

## Basic usage

```ts
import { AudioTee, AudioChunk } from 'audiotee'

const audiotee = new AudioTee({ sampleRate: 16000 })

audiotee.on('data', (chunk: AudioChunk) => {
  // chunk.data contains a raw PCM chunk of captured system audio
})

await audiotee.start()
// ... later
await audiotee.stop()
```

Unless otherwise specified, AudioTee will capture system audio from all running processes.

## Installation

`npm install audiotee`

Installation will download a prebuilt universal macOS binary which runs on both Apple and Intel chips, and weighs less than 600Kb.

## Options

The `AudioTee` constructor accepts an optional options object:

```ts
interface AudioTeeOptions {
  sampleRate?: number // Target sample rate (Hz), default: device default
  chunkDurationMs?: number // Duration of each audio chunk in milliseconds, defaults to 200
  mute?: boolean // Mute system audio whilst capturing, default: false
  includeProcesses?: number[] // Only capture audio from these process IDs
  excludeProcesses?: number[] // Exclude audio from these process IDs
}
```

## Events

AudioTee uses an EventEmitter interface to stream audio data and system events:

```ts
// Audio data events
audiotee.on('data', (chunk: { data: Buffer }) => {
  // Raw PCM audio data - mono channel, 32-bit float or 16-bit int depending on conversion
})

// Lifecycle events
audiotee.on('start', () => {
  // Audio capture has started
})

audiotee.on('stop', () => {
  // Audio capture has stopped
})

// Error handling
audiotee.on('error', (error: Error) => {
  // Process errors, permission issues, etc.
})

// Logging
audiotee.on('log', (message: string, level: LogLevel) => {
  // System logs from the AudioTee binary
  // LogLevel: 'metadata' | 'stream_start' | 'stream_stop' | 'info' | 'error' | 'debug'
})
```

### Event details

Note: a bug in versions up to and including 0.0.2 means only the `data` lifecycle event is actually currently emitted.

- **`data`**: Emitted for each audio chunk. The `data` property contains raw PCM audio bytes
- **`start`**: Emitted when audio capture begins successfully
- **`stop`**: Emitted when audio capture ends
- **`error`**: Emitted for process errors, permission failures, or system issues
- **`log`**: Emitted for all system messages from the underlying AudioTee binary

## Requirements

- macOS >= 14.2

## API stability

During the `0.x.x` release, the API is unstable and subject to change without notice.

## Best practices

- Always specify a sample rate. Tell AudioTee what you want, rather than having to parse the
  `metadata` message to see what you got from the output device
- Specifying _any_ sample rate automatically switches encoding to use 16-bit signed integers, which is half the byte size and bandwidth compared to the 32-bit float the stream probably uses natively
- You'll probably need to specify a different `chunkDuration` depending on your use case. For example, some ASRs are quite particular about the exact length of each chunk they expect to process.

## Permissions

There is no provision in the underlying AudioTee library to pre-emptively check the state of the required `NSAudioCaptureUsageDescription` permission. You _should_ be prompted to grant it the first time AudioTee.js tries to record anything, but at least some popular terminal emulators like iTerm and those built in to VSCode/Cursor don't. They will instead happily start recording total silence.

You can work around this either by using the built in macOS terminal emulator, or by granting system audio recording permission manually. Open Settings > Privacy & Security > Screen & System Audio Recording and scroll down to the **System Audio Recording Only** section (**not** the top 'Screen & System Audio Recording' section) and add the terminal application you're using.
