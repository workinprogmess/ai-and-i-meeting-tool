# electron version archive

**archived**: 2025-09-04  
**reason**: strategic pivot to native mac app for superior foundation and user experience

## what this folder contains

this is our complete working electron app with all the progress we made:
- ✅ working dual-file electron-audio-loopback approach  
- ✅ gemini 2.5 flash end-to-end transcription
- ✅ comprehensive ui with sidebar, recordings, tabbed views
- ✅ memory optimization (99.7% reduction via stream-to-disk)
- ✅ device switching support and error recovery
- ✅ complete transcription and summary pipeline

## key achievements preserved

**milestone 1**: real-time transcription with ffmpeg + avfoundation ✅  
**milestone 2**: sally rooney-style human-like summaries ✅  
**milestone 2.5**: human-centered meeting intelligence as default ✅  
**milestone 3.1.9**: clean gemini end-to-end implementation ✅  
**milestone 3.2**: advanced audio capture & speaker recognition ✅  
**milestone 3.3**: transcription reliability improvements ✅  
**milestone 3.3.5**: mixed audio capture research and breakthrough ✅  

## why we archived this

while this electron version works, we discovered that:
- native mixed audio requires complex swift bridge architecture
- electron limitations create permission friction (especially macos 15)
- native mac app provides superior foundation for scaling
- direct core audio access eliminates workaround complexity

## valuable learnings preserved

- comprehensive core audio research  
- transcription service integration patterns
- ui/ux design decisions and user feedback
- error handling and edge case solutions
- performance optimization techniques
- collaborative development methodology

## reference value

this code remains valuable for:
- understanding our decision-making process
- referencing working transcription integration
- ui patterns and user experience decisions
- fallback option if native development faces blockers
- knowledge transfer to future team members

the electron version represents months of learning and refinement - we're not discarding this work, but building on it with a superior architecture.
