# audio timing accuracy research - ai&i

## problem statement
**discovered issue**: progressive timing loss in ffmpeg + avfoundation audio recordings
**symptoms**: recorded duration consistently shorter than actual recording time
**impact**: affects user experience, duration display accuracy, and data integrity concerns

## timing loss data pattern
**test results (2025-08-29)**:
- 1:00 recording → 0:50 display (10s loss, 17% loss)
- 5:08 recording → 4:34 display (34s loss, 11% loss) 
- 7:31 recording → 6:41 display (50s loss, 11% loss)
- **33:13 recording → 29:35 display (3:38 loss, 10.8% loss)**

**pattern analysis**:
- not fixed startup delay (would be consistent across recording lengths)
- progressive timing drift that stabilizes around 10-11% loss
- worse for shorter recordings, stabilizes for longer ones
- significant absolute time loss increases with recording length

## root cause analysis
**ffmpeg + avfoundation timing issues**:
- documented in ffmpeg bug tracker #4089
- system clock vs audio hardware clock drift
- frame stitching timing errors from dropped frames
- sample rate conversion artifacts and hardware rate converter conflicts

**technical explanation**:
- avfoundation uses system clock rather than audio hardware clock
- dropped frames result in shorter duration at same framerate
- clock drift between system time and audio hardware accumulates over time

## industry solutions research
### how professional apps solve this
**granola/otter.ai approach**:
- use direct coreaudio implementation, not ffmpeg
- sample-count-based duration calculation (`totalSamples / sampleRate`)
- hardware timestamp synchronization (AudioTimeStamp.mSampleTime)
- drift correction through buffer monitoring

**audio hijack pro method**:
- private coreaudio apis for system audio capture
- custom drift correction algorithms
- separate timing threads for accuracy

**meeting apps best practices**:
- avoid ffmpeg + avfoundation for production audio recording
- implement direct coreaudio capture using AudioUnits
- use hardware timestamps, not system clock
- maintain ring buffer level monitoring for drift detection

## technical solutions identified
### option 1: sox replacement (immediate fix)
**advantages**:
- uses coreaudio directly on macos
- "crystal clear" audio quality vs ffmpeg's "cracks and pops"
- sample-accurate timing from hardware
- proven solution used by audio professionals

**implementation**:
```bash
sox -t coreaudio "Built-in Microphone" output.wav \
  rate 44100 channels 2
```

### option 2: ffmpeg timing corrections (band-aid)
**workaround flags**:
```bash
ffmpeg -framerate 44.1 -f avfoundation -i "none:0" \
  -af aresample=async=1 -ar 44100 -b:a 128k \
  -max_delay 1000000 -vsync 0 output.wav
```
- async audio resampling
- larger buffer size
- variable sync to handle timing drift

### option 3: sample-count duration calculation (proper fix)
**accurate duration formula**:
```javascript
const accurateDuration = totalBytesWritten / (sampleRate * channels * bytesPerSample);
// vs current: elapsed system time (which drifts)
```

**implementation approach**:
- track total pcm bytes written to disk
- calculate duration from actual audio samples processed
- display sample-based duration instead of system time elapsed

### option 4: direct coreaudio implementation (long-term)
**based on audiocap repository patterns**:
```swift
// use AudioDeviceCreateIOProcIDWithBlock for callback-based capture
// calculate duration from sample count, not system time
// use AudioTimeStamp.mSampleTime for accurate timing
// implement drift correction monitoring

let sampleRate = 44100.0
let totalSamples = recordedSampleCount
let accurateDuration = totalSamples / sampleRate
```

## impact assessment
### current user experience
- **transcript quality**: unaffected, gemini processes complete audio content
- **audio files**: complete and playable, timing display incorrect  
- **data concerns**: duration discrepancy creates user confusion
- **scale impact**: 10% loss on 60-minute meeting = 6 minutes discrepancy

### urgency evaluation
**critical question**: is this data loss or display error?
- need to verify transcript captures all spoken content
- need to manually time saved audio files vs displayed duration
- if data loss: critical fix required immediately
- if display error: important but can be addressed in milestone 3.3

## recommended implementation strategy
### phase 1: immediate diagnosis (milestone 3.2)
1. verify transcript completeness vs spoken content
2. manually time saved audio files to confirm data preservation
3. implement sample-count duration calculation as quick fix

### phase 2: production solution (milestone 3.3)
1. evaluate sox vs ffmpeg for audio quality and timing accuracy
2. implement sox-based recording if viable
3. add timestamp correction and drift monitoring

### phase 3: advanced implementation (milestone 3.4+)
1. direct coreaudio implementation using AudioCap patterns
2. hardware timestamp synchronization
3. ring buffer level monitoring for professional-grade accuracy

## competitive research findings
**ffmpeg alternatives used in production**:
- **sox**: command-line audio processing with coreaudio backend
- **blackhole**: virtual audio device with drift correction
- **ezaudio framework**: ios/macos framework built on core audio for real-time processing
- **direct coreaudio**: lowest latency and best timing accuracy

**key insight**: all professional meeting apps avoid ffmpeg + avfoundation for production due to these exact timing issues

## priority assessment - UPGRADED TO CRITICAL
**user impact**: **critical - users losing 10-11% of actual meeting content**
**technical complexity**: medium - proven solutions available via electron-audio-loopback
**milestone priority**: **upgraded to milestone 3.2 - production blocker**
**comparison**: successful apps solved this by abandoning ffmpeg entirely

## breakthrough deep research findings (2025-08-29 evening)

### confirmed root cause: 5-year-old unresolved ffmpeg bugs
**specific bugs causing our data loss:**
- **ffmpeg bug #4437**: race condition in `captureOutput:didOutputSampleBuffer:fromConnection` callback
- **ffmpeg bug #11398**: missing audio samples during buffer overflow situations
- **ffmpeg bug #4089**: avfoundation timing drift and sync issues on macos

**technical details:**
- race condition: callback called before `avf_read_packet`, causing premature frame freeing
- buffer overflow: audio frames dropped when buffers reach 1gb capacity limit  
- sample buffer timing: inconsistent timestamps from apple's sample buffers
- these bugs remain unresolved after 5+ years of reports

### granola architecture breakthrough
**confirmed: granola is electron app using alternative audio capture:**
- does NOT use ffmpeg + avfoundation (explains why they have no data loss)
- uses either electron-audio-loopback or native node modules
- electron + react router architecture (navigation challenges documented)
- gpt-4o for ai processing, similar to our gemini approach

### production-ready solution: electron-audio-loopback
**advantages:**
- zero data loss reported in production use
- uses native electron `getDisplayMedia()` apis
- bypasses ffmpeg completely
- maintains current architecture with minimal changes

**implementation pattern:**
```javascript
const { getLoopbackAudioMediaStream } = require('electron-audio-loopback');

const stream = await getLoopbackAudioMediaStream({
  systemAudio: false, // microphone only for meetings
  microphone: true
});

const recorder = new MediaRecorder(stream, {
  mimeType: 'audio/webm;codecs=opus',
  audioBitsPerSecond: 128000
});

// critical: use timeslice to prevent memory issues
recorder.start(60000); // 60-second segments
```

### implementation strategy
**phase 1: immediate fix (milestone 3.2)**
1. verify electron version >= 31.0.1
2. implement electron-audio-loopback as primary capture method
3. add real-time data loss monitoring
4. maintain ffmpeg as fallback with optimized parameters
