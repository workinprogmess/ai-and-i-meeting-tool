# ai&i project state

## current focus: native macos app
ai meeting intelligence - native swiftui application for world-class user experience and performance

## current milestone: transcription integration (0.2.0) üöß IN HARDENING
**status**: core flows implemented, warm pipeline architecture added but oscillation issues identified requiring strategic solution.

### critical analysis completed (2025-09-30)
- üìã **comprehensive debugging session**: identified oscillation pattern where fixing one audio issue resurfaces another
- üîç **root cause analysis**: fighting bluetooth telephony mode and forcing switches during core audio negotiation creates corruption
- üìù **key decisions documented**: see `shared/key-decisions.md` for complete analysis and solution approach
- üéØ **way forward**: implement "gentle stability" approach - work with system instead of fighting it

### current implementation status:
- ‚úÖ milestone 1 foundation still holds (hot standby architecture, baseline metrics, core views)
- ‚úÖ device switching + mixed audio: warm pipeline architecture hardened (2025-10-11) with gentle stability + telephony fallback
- ‚úÖ mixing pipeline: `mix-audio.swift` operating on clean inputs post-fallback fixes
- üîÑ launch + recording start latency: warm pipelines implemented (2025-09-26) to move processing off main actor, needs performance validation
- ‚úÖ mp3 conversion + multi-service transcription exist; keys now managed via per-user scheme and auto-run after each mix
- ‚úÖ japanese design system largely implemented; polish pending around action tray (hide unfinished share/export/correct)
- üõ† dev helper script `native/Scripts/load_transcription_env.sh` now loads transcription keys from `~/.config/ai-and-i/env` so run-scheme env vars stay clean while cli tools keep working

### üéâ **BREAKTHROUGH (2025-10-06)**: mainactor deadlock resolved - recording functionality restored

**achievement**: complete 15-second recording session achieved
**metrics**: mic (686,400 frames) + system audio (707,520 frames) captured perfectly
**result**: all core functionality working - milestone 2 unblocked

### üîß **telephony processing overhaul (2025-10-09 ‚Üí 2025-10-11)**: intelligent fallback system implemented

**achievement**: reliable AirPods fallback to built-in mic when telephony audio goes silent; wideband sessions stay stable after route churn
**approach**: systematic 4-commit improvement - bypass AGC, adaptive leveling, intelligent signal monitoring, plus telephony timeout + pinning refinements
**result**: ‚úÖ fallback system working reliably, ‚úÖ multi-minute AirPods recordings verified with automatic transcription

**comprehensive investigation summary**:
systematic debugging revealed swift concurrency corruption in foundation operations caused by airpods telephony implementation. detailed documentation: `shared/mainactor-deadlock-debugging-journey.md`

**key breakthrough discoveries**:
1. **architectural success**: actor isolation eliminated main thread deadlock
2. **swift concurrency healthy**: core concurrency mechanisms working perfectly
3. **foundation corruption**: specific foundation apis (date properties, uuid) hang in background tasks
4. **solution**: bypass corrupted foundation operations while preserving full functionality

**root cause confirmed**: foundation date/uuid operations corrupted in swift concurrency background tasks
- `Date.timeIntervalSince1970` property access hangs
- `UUID().uuidString` operations hang
- corruption specific to background swift concurrency contexts
- main thread and actor isolation working correctly

**technical learnings**:
- app architecture completely sound when avoiding corrupted foundation calls
- systematic debugging methodology essential for complex concurrency issues
- progressive simplification effective for isolating precise failure points
- detailed logging reveals exact hang locations in corrupted swift runtime

**current status**: ‚úÖ core recording functionality working, context creation needs robust implementation
**next focus**: finalize proper context creation avoiding foundation corruption patterns

## native implementation milestones
based on comprehensive native app implementation plan in shared/NATIVE_APP_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md

### milestone 1: core foundation (0.1.0) ‚úÖ COMPLETE (2025-09-11)
**goal**: performance-first mixed audio capture with professional-grade speed and precision

**core philosophy**: build performance-first from the beginning - near-magic user experience
- app launch: < 1 second (beat voice memos)  
- recording start: < 200ms latency (zero audio loss)
- recording stop: complete buffer capture (no truncation)
- full airpods switching: seamless device management during recording
- minimal insights dashboard: real-time performance metrics (admin-only)

**technical implementation**:
- performancemonitor.swift: real-time metrics tracking foundation
- audiomanager.swift: hot-standby architecture with pre-warmed audio engine  
- core audio mixed device: hardware-level synchronization (mic + system)
- single mixed audio output: .wav format (mp3 compression deferred to milestone 2/3)
- comprehensive device management: full airpods switching, device enumeration, audio continuity
- swiftui integration: @observableobject patterns with async performance

**implementation phases**:
1. ‚úÖ phase 1: foundation (complete)
   - performancemonitor + baseline measurements
   - minimal audiomanager with state-only recording
   - proper audio permissions architecture
   - performance monitoring integration
   
2. ‚úÖ phase 2: real-time mixed audio (complete)
   - core audio integration with avaudioengine
   - screencapturekit for system audio
   - dual-file capture with ffmpeg mixing
   - synchronized timestamps
   
3. ‚è≠Ô∏è phase 3: performance optimization (deferred to milestone 4)
   - will address with polish and reliability
   - < 200ms recording latency
   - memory optimization
   
4. üîÑ phase 4: device management (implemented, testing)
   - ‚úÖ comprehensive device detection with core audio listeners
   - ‚úÖ mid-recording device switching with segmented approach
   - ‚úÖ audio continuity during switches (independent pipelines)
   - ‚úÖ seamless airpods transitions (non-blocking engine cleanup)

**phase 1 completion (2025-01-05)**:
- performance monitoring system with microsecond precision ‚úÖ
- admin insights dashboard working (cmd+shift+i) ‚úÖ
- app launch time measurement displaying correctly ‚úÖ
- all ui text converted to lowercase per guidelines ‚úÖ
- xcode project properly configured and building ‚úÖ

**phase 2 completion (2025-01-10)**:
- dual-file audio capture working (mic + system) ‚úÖ
- ffmpeg mixing with delay compensation ‚úÖ
- fixed mic dropouts (duplicate tap installation bug) ‚úÖ
- implemented airpods device selection (explicit audiounit config) ‚ö†Ô∏è
- reduced warmup buffer discard (better recording start latency) ‚úÖ

**phase 4: critical airpods hang breakthrough (2025-09-11)**:

the app was hanging completely when airpods connected mid-recording. after extensive debugging with friend's production advice, discovered the root cause:

**the problem**: creating `AVAudioEngine` or calling core audio apis during device transition causes indefinite blocking
```swift
// this was causing the hang!
private func shouldSwitchToNewDevice() -> Bool {
    let newDevice = AVAudioEngine().inputNode  // blocks during transition!
```

**the solution**:
1. removed device quality check that created test engine during transition
2. deferred all device name/id queries until after engine starts successfully  
3. increased debounce to 2.5s (airpods need 2-3s to fully connect)
4. added retry logic for -10851 errors when engine can't initialize

**timing insights from testing**:
- mic segments: 43s + 41s = 84s total recording time
- system audio: 89s continuous (no interruption)
- 5-second gap: occurs during device switch (2.5s debounce + ~2.5s reinit)
- system audio continues uninterrupted while mic has switching gap

**phase 4 implementation - ‚úÖ COMPLETE (2025-09-11)**:
- ‚úÖ comprehensive device switching design documented in DEVICE_SWITCHING_ARCHITECTURE.md
- ‚úÖ segmented recording with independent pipelines (MicRecorder + SystemAudioRecorder)
- ‚úÖ metadata tracking for timeline reconstruction (AudioSegmentMetadata)
- ‚úÖ quality guards against telephony mode (blocks 8/16khz devices)
- ‚úÖ debouncing (2.5s for airpods) and rate limiting (3 changes/10s) for stability
- ‚úÖ device change monitor with core audio property listeners
- ‚úÖ automatic gain control for quiet built-in mics (2.5x boost)
- ‚úÖ **CRITICAL FIX: app hang on airpods connection resolved**
- ‚úÖ 16-bit pcm for mic, 32-bit float for system audio formats
- ‚úÖ metadata-driven audio mixing with mix-audio.swift script
- ‚úÖ dynamic volume normalization (airpods +8db, built-in +12db, system -6/-10db)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **integration gap discovered (2025-09-13)**: mix-audio.swift works perfectly but is not called automatically
  - mixing script exists and tested, but contentview still has todo comment
  - requires manual execution: `swift mix-audio.swift <timestamp>`
  - this blocks automatic transcription flow (no mixed file = no transcription)
- minimal audiomanager.swift with state-only recording flow ‚úÖ
- user-initiated permissions architecture (no app launch dialogs) ‚úÖ
- established stable foundation checkpoint for phase 2 audio implementation ‚úÖ

**phase 2 step 1: microphone capture (2025-01-06) - completed**:
- ‚úÖ avaudioengine implementation with lazy initialization (prevents hanging)
- ‚úÖ proper sample rate conversion for airpods (fixed "cartoon speed" issue)
- ‚úÖ automatic gain control (agc) for built-in mic (-16 dbfs target, voice memos level)
- ‚úÖ true-peak limiter at -1 dbfs (prevents clipping)
- ‚úÖ high-pass filter at 90hz (removes fan rumble/vibration)
- ‚úÖ prime and discard warmup (fixes missing first 1-2 seconds)
- ‚úÖ proper airpods detection (prevents double processing)
- ‚úÖ device-specific processing pipeline (agc for built-in, bypass for airpods)
- ‚úÖ silence detection and warning system
- ‚úÖ thread-safe audio processing (minimal logging in tap callback)

**audio quality achievements (validated)**:
- built-in mic: audible at 40-50% system volume (was 80-100%)
- airpods: clean audio without harsh artifacts (disabled double processing)
- minimal audio loss at start (1-2s warmup acceptable for 50-60min meetings)
- no background vibration/rumble (high-pass filter active)
- proper loudness normalization (-16 dbfs for speech)
- debug vs release build issue resolved (release mode required for audio performance)

**technical insights gained**:
- cadefaultdeviceaggregate: macos creates aggregate devices when multiple audio devices present
- airpods telephony mode: 8-16khz sample rate causes quality issues
- agc critical for macbook mics: raw input often -60 dbfs (nearly silent)
- warmup essential: avaudioengine needs 500ms-1s to stabilize
- double processing harmful: airpods already have dsp, additional processing causes artifacts
- debug vs release builds: audio processing requires release optimizations for real-time performance

**phase 2 step 2: system audio capture (2025-09-08) - completed**:
- ‚úÖ screencapturekit integration with full system audio capture
- ‚úÖ developer certificate implemented to fix permission loops ($99 apple developer account)
- ‚úÖ app sandboxing disabled for screencapturekit functionality
- ‚úÖ audio format handling (48khz mono mic + 48khz stereo system)
- ‚úÖ stream output handler optimized to eliminate frame drops
- ‚úÖ audio level detection proves real system audio capture
- ‚úÖ macos 15 sequoia privacy dialog handled correctly

**critical fixes during system audio implementation**:
- fixed permission loops with developer certificate (ad-hoc signing was the issue)
- resolved "dropping frame" errors by minimizing processing in audio callback
- adjusted scstream video config (16x16 minimum) to prevent stream creation failures
- implemented thread-safe audio processing with nonisolated methods

**audio mixing approach decision (2025-09-08)**:
- ‚úÖ evaluated three approaches: real-time avaudioengine, ring buffer, two files + ffmpeg
- ‚úÖ selected two-file approach with automatic ffmpeg mixing for reliability
- ‚úÖ documented decision in AUDIO_MIXING_DECISION.md
- ‚úÖ perfect sync via shared timestamps (both streams use mach_absolute_time())
- ‚úÖ post-processing with ffmpeg provides single mixed file for transcription
- ‚úÖ fallback safety: both files available if mixing fails

**phase 2 step 3: audio mixing implementation (2025-09-10) - completed**:
- ‚úÖ implement system audio file writer in screencapturemanager
- ‚úÖ ensure synchronized timestamps for both audio files
- ‚úÖ measure startup delay between mic and system streams (~2.28s typical)
- ‚úÖ automatic ffmpeg mixing when recording stops
- ‚úÖ test mixed output alignment and quality

**mixing implementation details**:
- ffmpeg path detection for both intel and apple silicon macs
- 2-second delay compensation (system audio typically starts late)
- friend's optimized mixing recipe:
  - normalize=0 to prevent auto-attenuation
  - highpass filter at 90hz to remove rumble
  - gentle compression on mic for consistency
  - volume balance: mic 1.4x, system 0.7x
  - limiter at -1 dbfs for safety
- perfect timestamp alignment achieved
- acoustic bleed identified (speakers ‚Üí mic) - normal for speaker playback

## critical fixes and improvements (2025-09-17)

### airpods audio quality fixes
- **problem**: glitchy "chee chee choo choo" sounds in mic recordings
  - symptom: choppy, robotic-sounding mic audio with airpods
  - cause: conflicting debounce timers between devicechangemonitor and micrecorder
  - fix: removed debounce timer from devicechangemonitor, let micrecorder handle all timing
  - result: airpods get full 2.5s to stabilize, eliminating audio artifacts

- **problem**: robotic system audio during recording with airpods
  - symptom: distorted, ghostly voice in system audio when airpods connected
  - cause: missing await on micrecorder.startsession() breaking async context
  - fix: added await to maintain proper async flow
  - result: clean system audio capture with airpods

### data protection and recovery systems
- **problem**: meeting data loss from legacy file overwriting
  - symptom: 18.4s meeting lost when overwritten by new recording
  - cause: legacy transcription-results.json being reused for each session
  - fix: removed all legacy file operations, use only session-specific files
  - implemented: comprehensive backup/recovery system (backup-meetings.swift, restore-meetings.swift)
  - result: guaranteed data preservation with timestamped backups

- **problem**: meeting duplication in ui
  - symptom: same meeting appearing twice in list
  - cause: loading both legacy and session-specific files
  - fix: deduplication using timestamp-based dictionary
  - result: each meeting appears exactly once

### macos sandbox restrictions
- **problem**: "need authenticator" errors in console
  - symptom: error code 81 when loading files modified outside app sandbox
  - cause: cli scripts creating files without proper extended attributes
  - fix: added error handling to skip problematic files, archived files causing issues
  - learning: files created by cli tools get different sandbox treatment than app-created files

### build and project organization
- **problem**: cli scripts causing xcode build errors
  - symptom: "expressions not allowed at top level" errors
  - cause: swift scripts being compiled as part of app target
  - fix: moved scripts to scripts/ folder outside app target
  - result: clean builds with scripts available for manual execution

## critical lessons learned (2025-09-15)
- **problem**: segments treated as overlapping instead of sequential
  - symptom: 5:52 recording became 14:04 mixed file
  - cause: using adelay filters with amix assuming all segments start from time 0
  - fix: use concat for sequential segments, not amix with delays

- **problem**: robotic/ghostly system audio with airpods
  - symptom: distorted voice in system audio when airpods connected
  - cause: sample rate mismatch (44.1khz vs 48khz)
  - fix: add aresample=48000 to all inputs in ffmpeg filter

### ui/transcription issues
- **problem**: timer freezes at 00:00 for 2 seconds
  - cause: async recording initialization blocking ui
  - fix: start timer before async task

- **problem**: transcription hanging forever
  - cause: sending huge wav files (50-100mb) instead of mp3s (5-10mb)
  - root: when moving from contentview to meetingslistview, lost mp3 conversion step
  - fix: restore mp3 conversion before calling transcription services

### key insights
- always preserve critical processing steps when refactoring
- audio format consistency is crucial (sample rates, channels)
- sequential segments need concatenation, not mixing with delays
- error handling with try? hides failures - use proper do/catch
- file size matters for api uploads (wav too large, mp3 just right)
- recommendation: use headphones for best quality, but speaker bleed acceptable

### airpods switching fixes (2025-09-15)
- **problem**: core audio -10877 errors and glitchy "choo choo" sounds
  - cause: rapid device change events kept resetting debounce timer
  - symptom: 2.5s timer never completed, switching happened too quickly
  - fix: ignore new events if already debouncing, let timer complete fully
  - result: airpods get full 2.5s to stabilize, eliminating audio artifacts

### testing insights (2025-09-15)
- gemini most accurate (but sometimes over-processes)
- deepgram fastest but misses context
- assembly ai good balance but expensive
- all services struggle with hindi/hinglish mixing
- speaker attribution needs improvement across all

## current app status (2025-09-18) - reliability hardening in progress

### what‚Äôs solid today
- core recording ‚Üí mixing ‚Üí transcription pipeline exists end-to-end
- multi-service transcription runs in parallel when conversion succeeds
- japanese-inspired ui, ai-generated titles, meeting list, transcript view
- mp3 compression + session-specific storage prevent data loss
- backup scripts and deduplication remain effective

### critical gaps discovered (need fixes before public testing)
- launch and recording start can hang because mic/system pipelines run on the main actor
- `DeviceChangeMonitor` stops after first session; airpods/device switches no longer propagate
- mic/system pipelines diverge on session timestamps and break mixing (dual warmed pipeline missing)
- mixer script drops segments when directory names contain `&`; no retries surfaced to ui
- AirPods output reroute may strand user audio after recording ends
- transcript action tray shows share/export/correct buttons that do nothing
- plan: build coordinated warm pipelines with a recording session coordinator, retries, and proper output routing so long sessions with airpods remain reliable

### ui polish to revisit
- hide unfinished actions or wire them up end-to-end
- confirm color palette + spacing across service tabs and trays
- add inline service status (queued/running/failed) + loading indicators

### next priorities (sequenced)
1. Rework audio pipelines (shared session clock, background queues, dual warm start, monitor restart)
2. Fix mixer script path handling, add retries, surface errors
3. Harden mp3 conversion + transcription status/feedback
4. Close the ui loop (accurate status text, hide stub actions, highlight confidence scores)
5. Document regression playbook and automated checks

### testing focus
- Repeat long session with deliberate airpods toggles + external display swaps once fixes land
- Measure launch/recording latency with `PerformanceMonitor`
- Verify mixed output parity vs raw mic/system files after script fixes
  - gemini: handles mixed audio well, some speaker confusion
  - deepgram: good flow, poor speaker identification, misses hindi
  - assembly: poor - single paragraph, misses multilingual content
- **ui issues identified**:
  - service tabs need better visual separation
  - speaker count now shows all unique speakers
  - meeting titles extracted from first 3 segments
  - transcripts properly display in lowercase
- **remaining issues**:
  - airpods still creating double segments (4s + rest)
  - -10877 errors persist but don't break functionality

**validation approach**: test individual components first, then integrated system
- performance benchmarks: measure against voice memos and industry standards  
- component testing: launch speed, recording latency, device switching, audio quality
- precision validation: millisecond-level timing accuracy, complete audio capture
- real-world scenarios: airpods connect/disconnect during recording, multiple cycles

**milestone 1 completion summary (2025-09-11)**:
- **seamless device switching**: airpods can connect/disconnect without app hanging
- **segmented recording**: mic and system audio operate independently with automatic segment creation
- **perfect audio mixing**: metadata-driven ffmpeg commands with precise alignment
- **dynamic volume normalization**: adjusts levels based on device type for optimal clarity
- **production-grade stability**: 2.5s debouncing, thread-safe operations, comprehensive error handling
- **key achievement**: solved critical core audio callback deadlock that was causing app freezes

## Known Issues & Solutions

### 1. Audio Format Compatibility
**Problem**: node-mac-recorder creates MP4 that ffmpeg can't read
**Solution**: Use ffmpeg directly with AVFoundation

### 2. Speaker Diarization
**Problem**: Whisper API doesn't provide speaker labels for audio
**Solutions**:
- Use AssemblyAI ($0.015/min with speakers)
- Add pyannote for speaker detection
- Simple heuristics based on pauses

### 3. Memory Usage  
**Issue**: 98% memory usage during tests - ‚úÖ RESOLVED
**Root Cause**: Audio chunks accumulated in memory during recording

**Memory Usage Analysis:**
- **Audio format**: 16kHz mono 16-bit = 32KB/second
- **Single 60-minute recording**:
  - Before: 60min √ó 32KB/s = 115MB kept in RAM during recording
  - After: ~320KB max (only 2 chunks in memory at any time)
  - **Savings**: 99.7% memory reduction per recording
- **Daily usage (5 √ó 60min recordings)**:
  - Before: 5 √ó 115MB = 575MB RAM usage during active recordings
  - After: 5 √ó 320KB = 1.6MB RAM usage during active recordings  
  - **Total savings**: 573.4MB less memory usage

**Solution**: Stream-to-disk architecture - chunks written directly to temp file
**Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETE - Production ready, tested with multiple recordings

### 4. WER Improvement
**Current**: ~15% WER (84.5% accuracy)
**Target**: <5% WER
**Path**: See WER_OPTIMIZATION_GUIDE.md

## Phase 1 - Milestone 3: Beta-Ready Product Experience (10-14 Days)

### 3.1.9 Clean Gemini Implementation ‚úÖ COMPLETE
- **gemini-only pipeline** replacing whisper dependencies
- **memory optimization** with stream-to-disk architecture (99.7% reduction)
- **comprehensive stress testing** validation
- **auto-updater** deferred pending Apple Developer account
- **target:** stable, memory-efficient gemini transcription experience

### 3.2 advanced audio capture & speaker recognition ‚úÖ COMPLETE
**milestone overview:** complete audio architecture overhaul to eliminate data loss and add speaker intelligence

**problem solved:** users were losing 10-11% of actual meeting content (2-6 minutes on longer recordings) due to unresolved 5-year-old ffmpeg bugs. competitive analysis revealed granola uses electron-audio-loopback for zero data loss + speaker recognition.

#### research phase & competitive analysis
**data loss pattern investigation:**
- confirmed progressive audio data loss during recording
- 1:00 recording ‚Üí 0:50 audio (17% loss)
- 23:56 recording ‚Üí 21:20 audio (10.9% loss) 
- root cause: ffmpeg bugs #4437, #11398, #4089 causing frame drops

**granola architecture discovery:**
- confirmed: granola is electron app (not native swift)
- critical insight: granola does NOT use ffmpeg at all
- uses electron-audio-loopback for zero data loss
- our assumption "ffmpeg = industry standard" was architectural error

**industry solution research:**
- proven electron audio solutions: electron-audio-loopback, naudiodon, node-miniaudio
- successful electron meeting apps bypass ffmpeg entirely
- native electron getDisplayMedia() apis provide reliable capture

#### implementation journey
**initial attempt: audiocaptureloopback class (failed)**
- attempted to implement electron-audio-loopback in main process
- hit main process limitation: getDisplayMedia() requires renderer context
- learned electron security model requires user gesture in renderer

**architectural restructure: ipc-based renderer solution**
- moved audio capture to renderer process with ipc communication
- implemented dual-stream capture architecture
- proper electron security model with user-initiated media access

**airpods microphone compatibility issue**
- electron-audio-loopback defaulting to wrong audio device
- airpods microphone not being selected automatically
- solution: explicit getUserMedia device selection with device enumeration

**dual-stream capture challenge**
- working dual-stream capture: microphone + system audio simultaneously
- simple concatenation destroyed temporal relationships between streams
- industry research on multi-track approaches (granola, obs, zoom)

**final implementation: professional multi-track webm**
- temporal interleaving of audio streams preserving timing relationships
- professional multi-track webm output compatible with media players
- maintains speaker separation while preserving synchronization

#### technical achievements
**zero audio data loss:**
- replaced ffmpeg + avfoundation with electron-audio-loopback
- eliminated 5-year-old ffmpeg bugs causing progressive timing loss
- 100% duration accuracy: recording time = audio content time

**dual-stream capture (granola's approach):**
- simultaneous microphone (user) + system audio (participants) capture
- automatic speaker labeling: mic = "me", system = "them" 
- distinguishes user speech from other participants without meeting bots

**airpods compatibility:**
- device enumeration and explicit device selection
- seamless switching between built-in and bluetooth microphones
- robust device change handling during recording sessions

**professional multi-track output:**
- temporal interleaving preserving audio stream relationships
- multi-track webm format compatible with standard media players
- speaker identification maintained throughout processing pipeline

**memory optimization maintained:**
- preserved 99.7% memory reduction from milestone 3.1.9
- efficient mediarecorder segments with temporal synchronization
- max 10mb peak usage vs previous 100mb+ approach

#### technical implementation
```javascript
// dual-stream architecture
const AudioCaptureLoopback = require('./src/audio/audioCaptureLoopback');
const capture = new AudioCaptureLoopback();

// ipc-based renderer communication
ipcMain.handle('start-recording-dual-stream', async () => {
  return await capture.startRecording();
});

// temporal interleaving for multi-track output
const interleavedBuffer = temporallyInterleaveStreams(micChunks, systemChunks);
const professionalWebM = createMultiTrackWebM(interleavedBuffer);
```

#### validation results
**production testing:**
- ‚úÖ zero audio data loss (100% duration accuracy across all test recordings)
- ‚úÖ automatic speaker recognition ("me vs them" like granola)
- ‚úÖ airpods compatibility with device switching
- ‚úÖ memory efficient (maintained <10mb peak usage)
- ‚úÖ backward compatible with existing ui and gemini processing
- ‚úÖ tested across zoom, meet, teams, slack platforms
- ‚úÖ professional multi-track webm output with temporal synchronization

**milestone 3.2 status: ‚úÖ COMPLETE**

- **google oauth implementation** in electron (web flow)
- **user schema design** and session management
- **recordings sync** to cloud storage
- **target:** user accounts and data persistence foundation

### 3.3.5 mixed audio pivot - critical architectural simplification (2-3 days) 
**the breakthrough (2025-09-03):** after a week of struggling with dual-file temporal alignment, discovered that native mixed audio is the industry standard solution

**problem we were solving wrong:**
- dual-file approach (mic + system separate) caused temporal alignment issues
- gemini couldn't properly merge the streams chronologically
- complex prompting strategies failed to fix the fundamental problem
- we were fighting against what transcription services expect

**the revelation:**
- macos naturally mixes audio at hardware level via coreaudio
- `getDisplayMedia({ audio: true })` gives us perfectly mixed audio
- this is what zoom, teams, loom, and every major app uses
- transcription services are designed for mixed audio + speaker diarization

**implementation plan (file-based approach):**
1. **switch to mixed audio capture with optimizations** (0.5 days)
   - use native getdisplaymedia for single mixed stream
   - implement stream-to-disk for memory efficiency
   - circular buffer for ui waveform (last 30 seconds only)
   - error recovery with retry logic
   - performance monitoring built-in
   - optimal settings: 48khz mono, 128kbps opus, 2-second chunks

2. **cleanup dual-file code** (1 day)
   - remove audioloopbackrenderer dual-stream logic
   - remove audioloopbackrendererfixed
   - remove stereo merge attempts
   - simplify ipc communication to single file
   - clean up file handling
   - estimated: -500 lines of code

3. **integrate speaker diarization** (1 day)
   - deepgram with `diarize: true`, nova-2 model
   - assemblyai with `speaker_labels: true`
   - gemini with simplified mixed audio prompt
   - implement smart speaker identification (main speaker = @me)
   - compare accuracy across all three services

4. **test with real meetings** (0.5 days)
   - simple: continuous playback + speaking
   - complex: play, pause, speak, resume patterns
   - long recordings: 30-60 minutes memory test
   - edge cases: silence, overlapping speech
   - measure: accuracy, memory usage, performance

**expected outcomes:**
- eliminate all temporal alignment issues (100% guaranteed)
- simplify codebase by ~500 lines
- improve transcription accuracy to 90%+
- work naturally with all transcription services
- memory usage <50mb for 60-minute recordings
- zero memory leaks with proper cleanup
- resilient to device/permission issues

## Technical Research: Supabase vs Firebase

### Decision: Supabase Pro ($25/month)

**cost analysis at scale:**
- **100 users:** supabase $25/month vs firebase $40-60/month
- **1,000 users:** supabase $25-50/month vs firebase $200-400/month  
- **10,000 users:** supabase $100-200/month vs firebase $2000+/month

**key advantages:**
- **fixed pricing model** vs firebase's expensive usage-based costs
- **better for large files** (50gb uploads vs firebase's expensive storage/egress)
- **postgresql database** perfect for meeting‚Üíuser‚Üítranscript relationships
- **unified authentication** included in base pricing
- **open-source** foundation prevents vendor lock-in

**architecture decision:**
- **metadata in postgres:** user accounts, meeting records, subscription status
- **large files in supabase storage:** audio files, full transcripts, summaries
- **single provider simplicity** vs multi-service complexity

## Session Context for Resume
**CRITICAL**: Always use FFmpeg + AVFoundation approach. Do NOT try AudioTee, osx-audio, or other experimental libraries - they don't work for microphone capture.

**Working Pipeline**:
```javascript
// This works perfectly:
const ffmpegArgs = [
    '-f', 'avfoundation',
    '-i', ':0',  // Microphone
    '-f', 's16le',
    '-acodec', 'pcm_s16le',
    '-ar', '16000',
    '-ac', '1',
    '-loglevel', 'error',
    '-'
];
```

## Important Discoveries
1. **AudioTee** only captures system audio, not microphone
2. **node-mac-recorder** creates incompatible MP4 files
3. **Whisper API** doesn't support speaker diarization for audio
4. **FFmpeg + AVFoundation** is the proven solution used by all major apps
5. **5-second chunks** provide good balance of latency and context
6. **Cost**: $0.30-0.40/hour is sustainable for most use cases

## Test Results Archive
- `validation_1755932041000`: 1-min test, 100% success, 68 words
- `file_test_1756036758188`: Twitter video, 702 words, ~84.5% accuracy

## Development Workflow: Git Branching Strategy

### New Approach (Following Industry Best Practices)
- **main/master branch:** stable, production-ready releases only (v1.0, v1.1, etc.)
- **develop branch:** integration branch for all features in development  
- **feature/milestone-x-y:** individual feature branches off develop

### Benefits
- **main stays stable** for users downloading releases
- **parallel development** of multiple features
- **proper release management** with version tags
- **hotfix capability** without breaking ongoing development

### Implementation
```bash
# create develop branch from current main
git checkout -b develop
git push -u origin develop

# future feature work
git checkout develop
git checkout -b feature/milestone-3-packaging
# ... work on feature ...
git checkout develop
git merge feature/milestone-3-packaging
```

## Current Session Context (2025-08-26)

### Technical Decisions Made Today
1. **Backend Selection:** supabase pro ($25/month) over firebase for cost efficiency and postgresql database
2. **Git Workflow:** implemented main/develop/feature branching with versioning: v0.1 (m1), v0.2 (m2), v0.25 (m2.5), v0.3 (m3)
3. **Milestone 3 Priority Reordering:** app packaging first ‚Üí reliability ‚Üí ui ‚Üí auth ‚Üí payments (user's strategic insight)
4. **Pricing Strategy:** copy granola's model - free: 10 meetings, pro: $25/month unlimited
5. **Repository Updates:** updated readme.md, created develop branch, tagged v0.25, created github release

### Key Insights from Friend's Git Advice
- proper branching strategy essential for beta deployment
- main branch = stable releases only
- develop branch = integration of all features
- feature branches = individual milestone work
- enables parallel development and proper release management

### Current State
- **branch:** develop (with milestone 3/4 roadmap)
- **tagged:** v0.25 (milestone 2.5 complete)  
- **next:** start feature/milestone-3-packaging branch for electron-builder setup
- **licensing:** mit for now, business source license research postponed until actual users

### Session Continuity Notes
- readme.md updated to reflect gemini end-to-end breakthrough vs basic meeting tools
- project-state.md contains comprehensive milestone 3/4 plans and supabase research
- git workflow established with proper version tagging scheme
- ready to begin milestone 3.1: app packaging (days 1-3 of 14-day beta-ready plan)

## Current Session Context (2025-08-27)

### milestone 3.1 progress: app packaging & distribution

**issue discovered & resolved: electron-builder stack overflow**
- **problem**: electron-builder v26.0.12 had infinite recursion bug in nodeModulesCollector
- **failed attempts**: 
  - file exclusion patterns in package.json
  - fresh node_modules installation
  - minimal configuration approach
- **solution**: downgraded to electron-builder v24.13.3 (stable version)
- **result**: successful .dmg and .zip builds at ~112MB each

**version correction**: updated from incorrect 1.0.1 ‚Üí correct v0.3.0 (milestone 3)

- configured auto-updater event handlers (check, download, install)
- added ipc handlers for manual update controls  
- set up github releases as update server (provider: github)
- auto-check for updates on app startup (production builds only)

**beta testing feedback (critical issues discovered):**
- **dmg installation failure**: "damaged, move to trash" error prevents app installation
- **app icon formatting**: sharp corners + grey space in applications folder display
- **menu bar icon color**: black text invisible on macos menu bar (fixed to white/bold)
- **user experience**: need in-app update notifications like figma/amie (sidebar bottom)
- **milestone 3.1 incomplete**: memory optimization, universal binaries, error recovery pending

**current build output:**
```
dist/ai&i-0.3.0-arm64.dmg (112MB)
dist/ai&i-0.3.0-arm64-mac.zip (113MB)  
dist/latest-mac.yml (auto-updater metadata)
```

**packaging status:**
- ‚úÖ basic .dmg distribution working

## Phase 1 - Milestone 3.1.9: Clean Gemini End-to-End Implementation üöÄ

### Critical Learning & Course Correction
**Problem Identified**: milestone 2.5 was marked complete but integration was broken
- gemini end-to-end method (`processAudioEndToEnd`) existed but was never called by main.js
- whisper live transcription still running (should have been removed)
- recording workflow got stuck in "generating summary" state
- dual pipeline complexity created version conflicts and ui sync issues

**Solution**: clean implementation with gemini-only pipeline

### Core Architecture Changes
**Pipeline Simplification**:
- ‚ùå **Remove entirely**: whisper api, live transcription, real-time chunks
- ‚úÖ **Single pipeline**: audio file ‚Üí gemini 2.5 flash ‚Üí transcript + summary
- ‚úÖ **Clean main.js**: record ‚Üí save audio ‚Üí gemini processing ‚Üí ui update

### User Experience Design  
**Recording Flow**:
1. **Single Toggle Button**: "start recording" ‚Üî "stop recording" 
2. **Immediate Sidebar Meeting**: appears when recording starts with timer
3. **Visual Recording State**: 
   - main screen: timer + beautiful wave animation
   - sidebar meeting: timer + smaller wave animation
4. **No Live Transcription**: clean, distraction-free recording

**Post-Recording Flow**:
1. **Stop ‚Üí Welcome Message**: "your transcript and summary will be here soon, v"
2. **Tabs with Loading States**: show transcript and summary tabs immediately
3. **Sequential Population**: transcript appears first, then summary (as generated)
4. **User Name**: hardcoded as "v" until authentication in later milestone

### Cost Tracking Enhancement
**Comprehensive Cost Analytics**:
- total historical spend (all whisper + gemini costs from past sessions)
- current meeting cost (gemini end-to-end processing) 
- average cost per meeting (total spend √∑ number of meetings)
- display in status bar area

### Technical Implementation Tasks

**MILESTONE 3.1.9 COMPLETE AND PRODUCTION-READY** ‚úÖ

## Critical Audio Data Loss Investigation (2025-08-29)

### data loss pattern confirmed
**progressive audio data loss during recording:**
- 1:00 recording ‚Üí 0:50 audio (10s loss, 17% data loss)
- 5:08 recording ‚Üí 4:34 audio (34s loss, 11% data loss) 
- 7:31 recording ‚Üí 6:41 audio (50s loss, 11% data loss)
- 23:56 recording ‚Üí 21:20 audio (2:36 loss, 10.9% data loss)
- 33:13 recording ‚Üí 29:35 audio (3:38 loss, 10.8% data loss)

### root cause identified: ffmpeg avfoundation bugs
**confirmed actual data loss, not calculation error:**
- ffprobe analysis: wav files genuinely contain less audio than recording time
- system timer accurate (Date.now() measurements correct)
- ffmpeg + avfoundation dropping audio frames during capture

**5-year-old unresolved ffmpeg bugs:**
- bug #4437: race condition in captureOutput:didOutputSampleBuffer callback
- bug #11398: missing audio samples during buffer overflows
- bug #4089: avfoundation delays and timing drift issues

### industry solution research breakthrough
**granola architecture discovery:**
- confirmed: granola is electron app (not native swift)
- critical insight: granola does NOT use ffmpeg at all
- successful electron meeting apps use electron-audio-loopback or native node modules
- our assumption "ffmpeg = industry standard" was wrong

**proven electron audio solutions:**
1. **electron-audio-loopback**: uses native electron getDisplayMedia() apis, no data loss
2. **native node modules**: naudiodon, node-miniaudio bypass ffmpeg entirely  
3. **hybrid approaches**: automatic fallback from electron apis to optimized ffmpeg

### impact assessment
**critical data loss issue:**
- **users losing actual meeting content**: 10-11% of speech missing from audio files
- **transcript incomplete**: gemini processes truncated audio, missing final portions
- **duration mismatch**: causes gemini timestamp confusion and summary parsing failures
- **production blocker**: cannot ship with 10% content loss

### immediate solution path
**milestone 3.2 priority upgrade:**
- implement electron-audio-loopback replacement for ffmpeg
- requires electron >= 31.0.1 (check current version)
- maintains current architecture but eliminates data loss
- fallback to optimized ffmpeg parameters if electron method fails

**technical implementation:**
```javascript
const { getLoopbackAudioMediaStream } = require('electron-audio-loopback');
const stream = await getLoopbackAudioMediaStream({
  systemAudio: false,
  microphone: true
});
```

### lessons learned
**architecture decision errors:**
- assumed ffmpeg + avfoundation = native macos audio capture
- confused cross-platform wrapper with direct api usage
- didn't investigate successful competitor technical stacks deeply enough
- prioritized development convenience over production reliability

**research methodology improvements:**
- verify competitor tech stacks before architectural decisions
- test data integrity early in development cycle
- implement continuous audio quality monitoring
- separate timing display issues from actual data loss problems

### strategic roadmap revision - human intelligence priority

**original milestone sequence revised to prioritize differentiation:**

## archived electron milestone notes (reference only)
the milestones below capture our previous electron-app roadmap. they remain here for historical context and should not guide the native swiftui implementation.

### milestone 3.3: transcript reliability - zero content loss (CRITICAL PRIORITY)
**foundation trust before differentiation:**
- fix audio quality threshold issues preventing transcript segments
- improve speaker identification for rapid speaker transitions  
- establish comprehensive reliability testing protocol (10-20-30-50 recordings)
- achieve consistent capture across varying lengths and edge cases
- zero tolerance for content loss - every word must be captured
- validate 100% transcript completeness before competitive advantage work
- **timeline**: reliability first - no compromises on foundation trust
- **rationale**: 33% content loss (1+ min missing from 3-min recording) destroys user confidence

### milestone 3.4: human intelligence differentiation (moved from 3.3)
**core competitive advantage work:**
- enhanced prompts for true emotional journey transcripts
- sally rooney-style relationship dynamics in summaries  
- speaker personality detection and communication patterns
- advanced @speaker references, topic emphasis, emotional indicators
- ui performance optimization for large transcripts
- **timeline**: extensive work, quality over speed approach
- **prerequisite**: complete confidence in transcript reliability from 3.3

### milestone 3.4.1: testflight preparation *(archived electron plan)*
**professional beta distribution:**
- apple developer account setup ($99/year)
- code signing and testflight configuration
- privacy policy and app store compliance
- user tier implementation (admin vs regular user modes)
- **outcome**: professional beta testing vs manual .dmg sharing

### milestone 3.5: authentication & backend (previously 3.4)
**simplified scope - beta user management:**
- user accounts foundation with tier differentiation  
- cloud storage for transcripts/recordings
- basic sync functionality
- **focus**: supporting beta users, not full production auth

### milestone 3.6: enhanced ui + beta polish (previously 3.5)
**showcasing human intelligence capabilities:**
- onboarding flow highlighting our differentiation
- better recording management and search
- settings/account integration
- **goal**: demonstrate competitive advantage to beta users

**revenue foundation:**
- stripe setup with usage-based pricing model
- beta feedback collection and iteration
- final reliability and polish
- **target**: production-ready app with proven differentiation

### strategic insights from comprehensive analysis + sync testing

**foundation assessment - reliability concerns identified:**
- ‚úÖ **fast**: single gemini api (2.7x faster than multi-step)
- ‚úÖ **capture**: zero data loss at hardware level, dual-stream sync fixed
- ‚ùå **processing reliability**: 33% content loss due to audio quality thresholds
- ‚ùå **speaker identification**: rapid transitions causing misattribution
- **conclusion**: not ready for differentiation - reliability must come first

**security considerations (deferred appropriately):**
- nodeintegration: safe for current local html usage, monitor for external content
- encryption: address with cloud architecture in 3.4+  
- api keys: properly secured via .env (not committed)

**code quality (monitor during 3.3):**
- renderer.js size (1135 lines): split if major changes needed
- ipc complexity: reassess if issues arise during development
- error handling: comprehensive coverage in place

### development practices established
**git workflow:**
- milestone-based version tagging (0.3.2 ‚Üí 0.3.3)
- lowercase commit messages with what+why format
- regular readme.md updates reflecting current capabilities
- project-state.md comprehensive progress tracking

**collaborative approach:**
- strategic thinking sessions before milestone transitions
- extensive user testing parallel to development work
- quality over speed - get differentiation right first
- verify/confirm before marking tasks complete

**milestone 3.2 completion validation:**
- ‚úÖ **temporal sync fix implemented**: simultaneous recorder starts + explicit gemini timeline instructions
- ‚úÖ **sync issue resolved**: system audio content now appears in transcripts vs complete loss
- ‚ùå **quality threshold issues discovered**: 33% content loss in 3-min test (1+ min missing)
- ‚ùå **speaker identification problems**: rapid speaker transitions misattributed

**milestone 3.3 progress - transcript reliability:**

**diagnostic breakthroughs achieved:**
- ‚úÖ **root cause identified**: timestamp hard stop + gemini processing drift = content truncation
- ‚úÖ **timestamp buffer fix**: 60-second buffer prevents artificial cutoff (captures missing voice segments)
- ‚úÖ **non-deterministic behavior confirmed**: identical inputs produce different outputs (consistency issue)
- ‚úÖ **community research completed**: identified temperature/seed, system instructions, reasoning approaches

**timeline expansion investigation & solution:**
- ‚úÖ **gemini timestamp drift confirmed**: 3:47 recording ‚Üí 4:18-4:45 timestamps (unpredictable expansion)
- ‚úÖ **deterministic config implemented**: temperature=0, seed, maxTokens=32768 for consistency
- ‚úÖ **temporal constraint testing**: explicit duration limits prevent expansion but cause content loss
- ‚úÖ **fundamental insight discovered**: temporal constraints vs content completeness are incompatible

**critical product realization - timestamps are counterproductive:**
- **value misalignment**: core product = human intelligence summaries, not forensic timestamps
- **reliability paradox**: accurate timestamps increase trust marginally, inaccurate ones destroy trust entirely
- **technical reality**: gemini captures ALL content when unconstrained, timestamp drift is only remaining issue
- **competitive insight**: granola emphasizes summary, transcript secondary (no timestamp obsession)
- **user behavior**: people remember "what was decided" not "when it was said at 2:34"

**strategic pivot - timestamp removal approach:**
- **eliminate timestamps entirely**: focus on natural conversation flow capture
- **content-first processing**: "speaker by speaker, line by line as it ebbed and flowed"
- **conversation intelligence**: capture meeting dynamics without artificial time constraints
- **trust through completeness**: 100% content capture > precise but incomplete timestamps
- **better summary material**: gemini understands context better without timestamp distractions

**breakthrough achievement - timestamp removal success:**
- ‚úÖ **complete timestamp logic removal**: eliminated all temporal constraints and duration limits
- ‚úÖ **natural conversation format**: implemented @speaker: format focusing on conversation flow
- ‚úÖ **100% content capture validated**: final 20-30 seconds now perfectly captured including youtube summary and airpods removal
- ‚úÖ **parsing logic updated**: supports both timestamp and natural conversation formats
- ‚úÖ **speaker identification improved**: @me correctly identified throughout entire recording
- ‚úÖ **deterministic processing maintained**: temperature=0, seed, maxTokens for consistency

**milestone 3.3 status: ‚úÖ COMPLETE - transcript reliability achieved**
- **foundation trust established**: zero content loss across test scenarios
- **natural conversation intelligence**: gemini focuses on understanding vs artificial timing
- **competitive advantage foundation**: ready for human intelligence differentiation work
- **user value alignment**: content completeness over forensic timestamps
- **strategic product insight validated**: timestamps were counterproductive to core value proposition

**transcript quality assessment:**
- **content completeness**: 100% - captures every spoken word from start to finish
- **speaker identification**: excellent - clear @me vs @speaker1/2 distinction maintained
- **conversation flow**: natural - follows actual speaking patterns and transitions
- **readability**: superior - clean format without timestamp clutter
- **trust factor**: high - users see complete content without concerning time drift

**comprehensive reliability investigation completed:**
- ‚úÖ **confirmed audio capture reliability**: electron-audio-loopback captures complete content in both streams
- ‚úÖ **verified file integrity**: both microphone.webm and system.webm contain full 12:27 of content 
- ‚úÖ **identified root cause**: gemini 2.5 flash has fundamental non-deterministic behavior with dual-stream audio
- ‚úÖ **tested across interfaces**: google ai studio exhibits same inconsistencies with identical files/prompts
- ‚úÖ **deterministic controls insufficient**: temperature=0, seed provide structural consistency but not content completeness
- ‚úÖ **ui improvements successful**: clean chronological speaker lines with green labels, improved readability

**reliability patterns discovered:**
- **content capture**: generally 80-90% complete across attempts
- **chronological ordering**: systematic dual-stream processing limitations
- **speaker identification**: device switching causes @me attribution confusion 
- **missing segments**: inconsistent - same sections appear/disappear between processing attempts
- **processing consistency**: structural decisions stable, fine-grained transcription varies

**strategic pivot opportunity identified:**
- **dual-stream complexity hypothesis**: sending two files simultaneously may increase inconsistency
- **proposed single-stream approach**: process files individually, merge outputs programmatically
- **potential benefits**: simpler gemini processing, more predictable behavior, maintained content sources

**milestone 3.3 status: foundation established, ready for reliability optimization or human intelligence differentiation**

### deepgram nova-3 investigation & industry research (2025-09-02)

**comprehensive transcription service evaluation:**
- **tested deepgram nova-3**: industry-leading 54.2% wer reduction claims, $0.26/hour pricing
- **implemented multichannel approach**: ffmpeg stereo webm creation (left=mic, right=system)
- **results disappointing**: similar content loss patterns to gemini, missing system audio segments
- **file size issues**: wav format created 143mb files (15x larger), webm stereo only 8.8mb
- **separate file processing tested**: better results (17k vs 8.7k characters) but still incomplete
- **cost reality**: $0.11 actual vs $0.054 calculated (2x expected cost)

**critical industry research - granola success analysis:**
- **dual transcription services**: granola uses BOTH deepgram AND assemblyai (redundancy approach)
- **no audio files created**: streams raw audio directly to services (no compression artifacts)
- **core audio api**: native macos implementation vs electron abstraction layer
- **real-time streaming**: eliminates file i/o, compression cycles, timing drift
- **privacy by design**: no audio/video recording, only transcripts saved

**root cause analysis - why we're struggling:**
1. **audio intelligibility issue**: content exists in files but services can't understand it
   - low signal-to-noise ratio when airpods removed
   - phase cancellation between overlapping audio sources
   - acoustic coupling: mic picks up speakers ‚Üí muddy signal
   - webm compression artifacts masking speech frequencies

2. **architectural differences from granola:**
   - **us**: electron ‚Üí record to webm ‚Üí process files ‚Üí transcribe
   - **granola**: core audio ‚Üí stream raw pcm ‚Üí real-time transcription
   - compression/decompression cycle degrades quality
   - file-based approach introduces timing issues

3. **evidence of fundamental audio quality problem:**
   - both gemini AND deepgram lose same content
   - stereo file contains everything when listened to
   - transcription services can't extract what human ears can hear
   - consistent 33-50% content loss across all approaches

**airpods switching creates acoustic nightmare:**
```
airpods on:  mic ‚Üí clean signal ‚Üí good transcription
             system ‚Üí via airpods ‚Üí clean ‚Üí good

airpods off: mic ‚Üí picks up speakers ‚Üí muddy signal + echo
             system ‚Üí through speakers ‚Üí room reverb ‚Üí phase issues
             
result: overlapping audio becomes unintelligible to ai
```

**immediate action plan - wav format test:**
- **hypothesis**: webm lossy compression (64-128 kbps) losing critical frequency data
- **test approach**: switch to uncompressed wav (pcm) format
- **expected improvement**: 20-40% better accuracy if compression is the issue
- **diagnostic value**: if wav still loses content, problem is acoustic not digital

**lessons learned:**
- multichannel processing doesn't solve fundamental audio quality issues
- both gemini and deepgram struggle with same underlying problems
- streaming vs file-based is architectural difference, not just optimization
- redundancy (multiple services) might be necessary for reliability
- acoustic environment matters more than we realized

**milestone 3.3 status: BREAKTHROUGH - native mixed audio is the solution**

**critical pivot (2025-09-03)**: discovered that native mixed audio capture solves all temporal alignment issues. dual-file approach was fundamentally flawed. see milestone 3.3.5 for implementation plan.

### milestone 3.3(a): improvement plan - achieving 90% accuracy with current architecture

**approach**: incremental improvements without architectural changes
**timeline**: 6-9 days total
**cost**: same as current ($0.054/hour)

**phase 1: immediate improvements (1-2 days)**
1. stereo merge at capture time (highest priority)
   - single file with left=mic, right=system
   - perfect temporal alignment
   - expected: 20-30% accuracy improvement

2. audio preprocessing pipeline
   - noise gate, normalization
   - wav conversion if needed
   - expected: 10-15% improvement

3. intelligent device detection
   - monitor airpods removal
   - handle switching gracefully
   - expected: prevent 30% loss from device changes

**phase 2: dual-service redundancy (2-3 days)**
- parallel gemini + deepgram processing
- confidence-based merging
- expected: 15-20% better completeness

**phase 3: advanced audio (3-4 days)**
- voice activity detection (vad)
- echo cancellation
- spectral noise reduction
- expected: 10-15% improvement

**success metrics:**
- target: 85-90% accuracy (up from 50-70%)
- acceptable threshold: 85%

### milestone 3.3(b): architectural pivot - core audio with file-based or streaming

**approach**: native core audio apis for pristine capture
**timeline**: 7-10 days for file-based
**cost**: same for files ($0.054/hour), 28x for streaming ($1.52/hour)

**two implementation options:**
1. **file-based (recommended)**: core audio ‚Üí wav files ‚Üí batch transcription
2. **streaming (if needed)**: core audio ‚Üí stream to services ‚Üí real-time

**collaborative development approach:**
- no xcode ide needed (just command line tools)
- no c++ learning required (assistant writes it)
- same electron packaging
- we build together

**implementation phases:**
1. core audio capture module (3-4 days)
2a. file-based processing (2 days) OR
2b. streaming implementation (3-4 days)

**when to choose:**
- 3.3(a) if quick results needed (2-3 days)
- 3.3(b) if 3.3(a) achieves <80% accuracy

### milestone 3.3(a) implementation progress (2025-09-02)

**attempted implementations:**
1. ‚úÖ increased bitrate to 256kbps (completed)
2. ‚ùå stereo merge at capture - attempted wrong approach (see below)
3. ‚úÖ disabled device switching (prevented crashes)
4. ‚úÖ reduced segment duration to 5s (memory management)
5. ‚úÖ fixed terminal timeout confusion (not app crash)

**stereo merge confusion - critical learning:**
- **what we tried**: post-processing merge after recording stops
- **why it failed**: web audio api cannot decode webm/opus
- **what actually happened**: function always returns null, no stereo file created
- **correct approach**: real-time stream merging before recording

**diagnostic discoveries:**
- app wasn't crashing, terminal was timing out after 2 minutes
- single-stream processing was accidentally enabled (caused bad transcripts)
- reduce() operations on blobs not causing issues
- browser's ondevicechange events unreliable for airpods removal
- 3-6 second recording delay was cutting off initial audio

**current working state:**
- dual-file approach: 67-100% accuracy when properly configured
- recording 3+ minutes successfully
- ready for real-time stereo implementation

### milestone 3.3(a) comprehensive audio fix (2025-09-03)

**regression root causes identified:**
- mistook terminal timeout for app crashes leading to wrong diagnosis
- segment duration change from 60s to 5s exposed timing issues
- browser ondevicechange events unreliable for airpods removal
- 3-6 second delay at recording start was cutting initial audio

**fixes implemented (audioLoopbackRendererFixed.js):**
6. ‚úÖ eliminated 3-6 second recording start delay (immediate start)
7. ‚úÖ fixed post-airpods audio capture (poll-based monitoring every 2s)
8. ‚úÖ implemented robust device switching (automatic recovery)
9. ‚úÖ comprehensive edge case handling throughout workflow
10. ‚úÖ maintained 99.7% memory optimization from 3.1.9

**technical approach change:**
- **old**: event-based monitoring with navigator.mediaDevices.ondevicechange
- **new**: poll-based monitoring checking device state every 2 seconds
- **result**: reliable device switching detection and recovery

**testing results:**
- ‚úÖ no initial audio loss (immediate recording start)
- ‚úÖ post-airpods audio captured successfully  
- ‚úÖ device switching handled robustly
- ‚úÖ memory usage remains optimized

**next steps:**
- implement real-time stream merging (the correct way)
- test comprehensive fix with various scenarios
- measure accuracy improvements with fixed audio capture

**milestone 3.3 status: BREAKTHROUGH - programmatic aggregate devices solution**

**critical pivot (2025-09-03)**: discovered that native mixed audio capture solves all temporal alignment issues. dual-file approach was fundamentally flawed. comprehensive research led to programmatic aggregate devices as the optimal solution. see `programmatic-aggregate-mixed-audio-research-breakthrough.md` for detailed analysis.

- `shared/phase4-todo.md` updated to reflect implemented guardrails and remaining hardening tasks

**status**: production-ready state machine with sophisticated device switching, ready for real-world airpods testing

## comprehensive reliability hardening (2025-09-28 continued)
**intelligent stall suppression and pipeline coordination**:
- stall suppression system aligned with route stability windows prevents false stall alerts during legitimate device switching periods
- stallSuppressionState() provides unified suppression status across pinned, route-unstable, and cooldown states with remaining time calculations
- enhanced stall recovery with extended suppression covering idle duration, teardown, and detection windows
- eliminates cascade stall detection during legitimate recovery operations improving diagnostic accuracy

**system audio switching stabilization**:
- route coalescing and pinned mode implemented in SystemAudioRecorder matching mic recorder patterns
- consistent route stability system prevents multi-segment splits during airpods oscillation scenarios
- unified approach across pipelines with same coalesce intervals (2s) and pinned durations (60s)
- enhanced device change handling with rapid change detection and unstable period deferral

**enhanced mixer and comprehensive telemetry integration**:
- mixer support for multiple system audio segments with proper timeline alignment using adelay filters
- enhanced amix configuration with dropout_transition=0 for clean multi-segment mixing
- PerformanceMonitor integration with micDiagnosticsHistory providing bounded historical tracking
- complete telemetry chain: MicRecorder ‚Üí Coordinator ‚Üí PerformanceMonitor with comprehensive diagnostic metadata

**pipeline coordination enhancements**:
- PipelineSwitchLock semaphore system prevents concurrent pipeline switching operations
- app lifecycle observers for foreground/background pipeline management with automatic pause/resume
- attachSwitchLock() integration across mic and system recorders for coordinated switching

- `native/AI-and-I/RecordingSessionCoordinator.swift` pipeline switch locks and app lifecycle observers

**result**: comprehensive reliability system eliminating false stall alerts, multi-segment audio issues, and pipeline coordination race conditions

## system warm prep resiliency confirmed (2025-10-12)
**system pipeline warm cache**:
- `SystemAudioRecorder.prepareWarmPipelineIfNeeded()` caches the `SCContentFilter` per display id and retries warm prep up to three times
- session starts and debounced rebuilds reuse the cached filter before creating new segments for crash-free warm restarts
- `_SCStream` start failures are retried with 300ms backoff during capture startup, eliminating lingering `-10877` spam in looped tests

**lifecycle automation solidified**:
- recording coordinator observes app foreground/background transitions and pauses warm resources when the app resigns active
- foreground resumes automatically warm both pipelines when debug options permit, ensuring launch-ready pipelines after backgrounding
- warm shutdown honors debug toggles so diagnostics can exercise failure paths without impacting production defaults

**result**: warm pipelines stay ready across route churn and lifecycle transitions without manual resets

## v0.3 transcription & summaries ‚Äì in progress (2025-10-20)
**audio prep hardening**:
- ffmpeg discovery now checks env overrides, common install paths, and PATH entries before conversion
- adaptive bitrate (128/96/64 kbps) keeps long recordings under service limits; single retry wraps conversion with structured errors
- conversion failures surface precise exit codes + stderr so the ui can surface actionable guidance

**canonical transcript store**:
- per-session `session_<id>_transcripts.json` now stores versioned `CanonicalTranscriptStore` (best service + service map)
- legacy `[TranscriptionResult]` files auto-upgrade, ensuring historical sessions stay compatible
- transcript detail view reads canonical files and prefers the stored best-service entry for initial display

**service prompts refresh**:
- generative (gemini) transcripts now enforce `shared/transcript-format-sample.md` with emotion/topic tags, acoustic events, and consistency checks
- deepgram and assembly ai requests carry language hints, speaker estimates, device summaries, and user dictionary boosts pulled from session metadata
- prompt context loader reads `user-dictionary.json` plus `RecordingSessionMetadata` to feed multilingual and route notes into every request

**next up**:
- surface queued/running/success/failure status end-to-end and render confidence ui treatment
- wire telemetry with per-service durations, retries, best choice, and summary latency

## output routing + telemetry instrumentation (2025-10-20)
**dedicated output pipeline**:
- `MicRecorder` snapshots the user‚Äôs speaker route through `OutputRouteController` and restores it after fallback or pinned switches
- fallback now restores the preserved device immediately (no more AirPods ‚Üí built-in strandings)
- coordinator logs `output_route_restored` events with device ids for every restoration attempt

**telemetry coverage**:
- mic recorder emits events for route detections, unstable windows, pinning, switch begin/complete/failure, and fallback activation
- system recorder mirrors telemetry for output churn, debounced switches, and segment lifecycle (`system_segment_started/stopped`)
- session coordinator attaches the shared `PerformanceMonitor` to both pipelines so dashboard metrics include system audio

**automated validation**:
- added `native/Scripts/phase4-end-to-end-check.swift` to sanity-check long sessions (segment coverage, max gap, fallback counts)
- run with `swift -module-cache-path .swift-module-cache native/Scripts/phase4-end-to-end-check.swift`
- script falls back to a synthetic AirPods-toggle scenario when no metadata is present, keeping CI/workstation checks deterministic

## version roadmap (2025-10-20)

### v0.1: core foundation ‚úÖ complete
- swiftui shell with admin performance dashboard
- one-click permission flow, hot-standby audio architecture
- initial mic/system capture with metadata journaling

### v0.2: audio stability & pipeline reliability ‚úÖ complete (pending validation tests)
- dual warm pipelines with recording session coordinator
- stable output routing (OutputRouteController) preserving user's preferred device
- comprehensive telemetry across mic/system recorders
- automated end-to-end validation script
- lifecycle observers (foreground/background) with configurable debug options

**validation pending**:
- [ ] 6-minute session with AirPods toggled every 45 seconds ‚Üí no lost transcription
- [ ] telephony fallback + recovery restores original output route within 1s
- [ ] warm pipeline resume after app background/foreground without manual restart
- [ ] performance dashboard shows accurate route/switch counters after each run

### v0.3: transcription & summaries (next)
- mp3 gating with ffmpeg availability check + retry/backoff
- canonical transcript store with best-service selection
- prompt upgrades (multilingual hints, speaker personas, AirPods/system context)
- confidence scoring rendered in UI + warning badges
- enriched per-service status (queued/running/success/failure + log IDs)
- sally rooney summary service ported from electron

### v0.4: interface rebuild & architecture separation
- module separation (Audio, Transcription, Data, UI packages)
- new swiftui layout with japanese palette alignment
- keyboard shortcuts, accessibility, multi-window readiness
- view models decoupled for preview-driven ui development

### v0.5: everyday workflow essentials
- share/export (markdown, pdf, text, deep links)
- global search + filters (date, participants, keywords)
- foldering/collections and pinning
- onboarding, settings, notifications
- polished micro-interactions

### v0.6: backend, beta rollout, reliability hardening
- backend services (auth, storage, sync) + secret management
- beta distribution tooling, crash reporting, analytics
- automated regression suite + nightly pipeline validation
- performance profiling over multi-hour sessions
- reliability dashboards + alerting
