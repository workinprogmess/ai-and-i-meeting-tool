## native implementation milestones
based on comprehensive native app implementation plan in shared/NATIVE_APP_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md

### milestone 1: core foundation (0.1.0) ✅ COMPLETE (2025-09-11)
**goal**: performance-first mixed audio capture with professional-grade speed and precision

**core philosophy**: build performance-first from the beginning - near-magic user experience
- app launch: < 1 second (beat voice memos)  
- recording start: < 200ms latency (zero audio loss)
- recording stop: complete buffer capture (no truncation)
- full airpods switching: seamless device management during recording
- minimal insights dashboard: real-time performance metrics (admin-only)

**technical implementation**:
- performancemonitor.swift: real-time metrics tracking foundation
- audiomanager.swift: hot-standby architecture with pre-warmed audio engine  
- core audio mixed device: hardware-level synchronization (mic + system)
- single mixed audio output: .wav format (mp3 compression deferred to milestone 2/3)
- comprehensive device management: full airpods switching, device enumeration, audio continuity
- swiftui integration: @observableobject patterns with async performance

**implementation phases**:
1. ✅ phase 1: foundation (complete)
   - performancemonitor + baseline measurements
   - minimal audiomanager with state-only recording
   - proper audio permissions architecture
   - performance monitoring integration
   
2. ✅ phase 2: real-time mixed audio (complete)
   - core audio integration with avaudioengine
   - screencapturekit for system audio
   - dual-file capture with ffmpeg mixing
   - synchronized timestamps
   
3. ⏭️ phase 3: performance optimization (deferred to milestone 4)
   - will address with polish and reliability
   - < 200ms recording latency
   - memory optimization
   
4. 🔄 phase 4: device management (implemented, testing)
   - ✅ comprehensive device detection with core audio listeners
   - ✅ mid-recording device switching with segmented approach
   - ✅ audio continuity during switches (independent pipelines)
   - ✅ seamless airpods transitions (non-blocking engine cleanup)

**phase 1 completion (2025-01-05)**:
- performance monitoring system with microsecond precision ✅
- admin insights dashboard working (cmd+shift+i) ✅
- app launch time measurement displaying correctly ✅
- all ui text converted to lowercase per guidelines ✅
- xcode project properly configured and building ✅

**phase 2 completion (2025-01-10)**:
- dual-file audio capture working (mic + system) ✅
- ffmpeg mixing with delay compensation ✅
- fixed mic dropouts (duplicate tap installation bug) ✅
- implemented airpods device selection (explicit audiounit config) ⚠️
- reduced warmup buffer discard (better recording start latency) ✅

**phase 4: critical airpods hang breakthrough (2025-09-11)**:

the app was hanging completely when airpods connected mid-recording. after extensive debugging with friend's production advice, discovered the root cause:

**the problem**: creating `AVAudioEngine` or calling core audio apis during device transition causes indefinite blocking
```swift
// this was causing the hang!
private func shouldSwitchToNewDevice() -> Bool {
    let newDevice = AVAudioEngine().inputNode  // blocks during transition!
```

**the solution**:
1. removed device quality check that created test engine during transition
2. deferred all device name/id queries until after engine starts successfully  
3. increased debounce to 2.5s (airpods need 2-3s to fully connect)
4. added retry logic for -10851 errors when engine can't initialize

**timing insights from testing**:
- mic segments: 43s + 41s = 84s total recording time
- system audio: 89s continuous (no interruption)
- 5-second gap: occurs during device switch (2.5s debounce + ~2.5s reinit)
- system audio continues uninterrupted while mic has switching gap

**phase 4 implementation - ✅ COMPLETE (2025-09-11)**:
- ✅ comprehensive device switching design documented in DEVICE_SWITCHING_ARCHITECTURE.md
- ✅ segmented recording with independent pipelines (MicRecorder + SystemAudioRecorder)
- ✅ metadata tracking for timeline reconstruction (AudioSegmentMetadata)
- ✅ quality guards against telephony mode (blocks 8/16khz devices)
- ✅ debouncing (2.5s for airpods) and rate limiting (3 changes/10s) for stability
- ✅ device change monitor with core audio property listeners
- ✅ automatic gain control for quiet built-in mics (2.5x boost)
- ✅ **CRITICAL FIX: app hang on airpods connection resolved**
- ✅ 16-bit pcm for mic, 32-bit float for system audio formats
- ✅ metadata-driven audio mixing with mix-audio.swift script
- ✅ dynamic volume normalization (airpods +8db, built-in +12db, system -6/-10db)
- ⚠️ **integration gap discovered (2025-09-13)**: mix-audio.swift works perfectly but is not called automatically
  - mixing script exists and tested, but contentview still has todo comment
  - requires manual execution: `swift mix-audio.swift <timestamp>`
  - this blocks automatic transcription flow (no mixed file = no transcription)
- minimal audiomanager.swift with state-only recording flow ✅
- user-initiated permissions architecture (no app launch dialogs) ✅
- established stable foundation checkpoint for phase 2 audio implementation ✅

**phase 2 step 1: microphone capture (2025-01-06) - completed**:
- ✅ avaudioengine implementation with lazy initialization (prevents hanging)
- ✅ proper sample rate conversion for airpods (fixed "cartoon speed" issue)
- ✅ automatic gain control (agc) for built-in mic (-16 dbfs target, voice memos level)
- ✅ true-peak limiter at -1 dbfs (prevents clipping)
- ✅ high-pass filter at 90hz (removes fan rumble/vibration)
- ✅ prime and discard warmup (fixes missing first 1-2 seconds)
- ✅ proper airpods detection (prevents double processing)
- ✅ device-specific processing pipeline (agc for built-in, bypass for airpods)
- ✅ silence detection and warning system
- ✅ thread-safe audio processing (minimal logging in tap callback)

**audio quality achievements (validated)**:
- built-in mic: audible at 40-50% system volume (was 80-100%)
- airpods: clean audio without harsh artifacts (disabled double processing)
- minimal audio loss at start (1-2s warmup acceptable for 50-60min meetings)
- no background vibration/rumble (high-pass filter active)
- proper loudness normalization (-16 dbfs for speech)
- debug vs release build issue resolved (release mode required for audio performance)

**technical insights gained**:
- cadefaultdeviceaggregate: macos creates aggregate devices when multiple audio devices present
- airpods telephony mode: 8-16khz sample rate causes quality issues
- agc critical for macbook mics: raw input often -60 dbfs (nearly silent)
- warmup essential: avaudioengine needs 500ms-1s to stabilize
- double processing harmful: airpods already have dsp, additional processing causes artifacts
- debug vs release builds: audio processing requires release optimizations for real-time performance

**phase 2 step 2: system audio capture (2025-09-08) - completed**:
- ✅ screencapturekit integration with full system audio capture
- ✅ developer certificate implemented to fix permission loops ($99 apple developer account)
- ✅ app sandboxing disabled for screencapturekit functionality
- ✅ audio format handling (48khz mono mic + 48khz stereo system)
- ✅ stream output handler optimized to eliminate frame drops
- ✅ audio level detection proves real system audio capture
- ✅ macos 15 sequoia privacy dialog handled correctly

**critical fixes during system audio implementation**:
- fixed permission loops with developer certificate (ad-hoc signing was the issue)
- resolved "dropping frame" errors by minimizing processing in audio callback
- adjusted scstream video config (16x16 minimum) to prevent stream creation failures
- implemented thread-safe audio processing with nonisolated methods

**audio mixing approach decision (2025-09-08)**:
- ✅ evaluated three approaches: real-time avaudioengine, ring buffer, two files + ffmpeg
- ✅ selected two-file approach with automatic ffmpeg mixing for reliability
- ✅ documented decision in AUDIO_MIXING_DECISION.md
- ✅ perfect sync via shared timestamps (both streams use mach_absolute_time())
- ✅ post-processing with ffmpeg provides single mixed file for transcription
- ✅ fallback safety: both files available if mixing fails

**phase 2 step 3: audio mixing implementation (2025-09-10) - completed**:
- ✅ implement system audio file writer in screencapturemanager
- ✅ ensure synchronized timestamps for both audio files
- ✅ measure startup delay between mic and system streams (~2.28s typical)
- ✅ automatic ffmpeg mixing when recording stops
- ✅ test mixed output alignment and quality

**mixing implementation details**:
- ffmpeg path detection for both intel and apple silicon macs
- 2-second delay compensation (system audio typically starts late)
- friend's optimized mixing recipe:
  - normalize=0 to prevent auto-attenuation
  - highpass filter at 90hz to remove rumble
  - gentle compression on mic for consistency
  - volume balance: mic 1.4x, system 0.7x
  - limiter at -1 dbfs for safety
- perfect timestamp alignment achieved
- acoustic bleed identified (speakers → mic) - normal for speaker playback

## critical lessons learned (2025-09-15)

### audio mixing issues
- **problem**: segments treated as overlapping instead of sequential
  - symptom: 5:52 recording became 14:04 mixed file
  - cause: using adelay filters with amix assuming all segments start from time 0
  - fix: use concat for sequential segments, not amix with delays

- **problem**: robotic/ghostly system audio with airpods
  - symptom: distorted voice in system audio when airpods connected
  - cause: sample rate mismatch (44.1khz vs 48khz)
  - fix: add aresample=48000 to all inputs in ffmpeg filter

### ui/transcription issues
- **problem**: timer freezes at 00:00 for 2 seconds
  - cause: async recording initialization blocking ui
  - fix: start timer before async task

- **problem**: transcription hanging forever
  - cause: sending huge wav files (50-100mb) instead of mp3s (5-10mb)
  - root: when moving from contentview to meetingslistview, lost mp3 conversion step
  - fix: restore mp3 conversion before calling transcription services

### key insights
- always preserve critical processing steps when refactoring
- audio format consistency is crucial (sample rates, channels)
- sequential segments need concatenation, not mixing with delays
- error handling with try? hides failures - use proper do/catch
- file size matters for api uploads (wav too large, mp3 just right)
- recommendation: use headphones for best quality, but speaker bleed acceptable

**validation approach**: test individual components first, then integrated system
- performance benchmarks: measure against voice memos and industry standards  
- component testing: launch speed, recording latency, device switching, audio quality
- precision validation: millisecond-level timing accuracy, complete audio capture
- real-world scenarios: airpods connect/disconnect during recording, multiple cycles

**milestone 1 completion summary (2025-09-11)**:
- **seamless device switching**: airpods can connect/disconnect without app hanging
- **segmented recording**: mic and system audio operate independently with automatic segment creation
- **perfect audio mixing**: metadata-driven ffmpeg commands with precise alignment
- **dynamic volume normalization**: adjusts levels based on device type for optimal clarity
- **production-grade stability**: 2.5s debouncing, thread-safe operations, comprehensive error handling
- **key achievement**: solved critical core audio callback deadlock that was causing app freezes

### milestone 2: transcription integration (0.2.0) - in progress

- ✅ quality score algorithm (0-100 based on coverage, word count, gaps)
- ✅ issue detection with severity levels (critical/warning/info)
- ✅ enhanced ui showing quality scores and specific issues
- **key findings**: gemini performs best (near perfect) and is cheapest ($0.002/min)
- **issues identified**: deepgram missing last 15-30s, assembly ai missing lines

**ui/ux design system created (2025-09-13)**:
- ✅ japanese-inspired color palette (kinari, gofun, etc)
- ✅ typography system with san francisco font
- ✅ wireframes for all major views
- ✅ landing page approach instead of sidebar
- ✅ floating action tray design
- ✅ recording flow with confirmations

**phase 3 ui implementation (2025-09-14) - ✅ REFINED**:

- **phase 3**: ✅ complete (ui basics - untested)
- **phase 4**: ui advanced + corrections integration (2 days) - next
- **phase 5**: testing & optimization + files api (1.5 days)
- **phase 6**: admin dashboard (deferred)
- **total remaining**: ~3.5 days
- three services in parallel: gemini, deepgram, assembly ai
- mp3 conversion for file size optimization (10x smaller)
- admin mode: see all three transcripts with metrics
- regular users: see best/fastest result only
- user corrections system: learns vocabulary over time
- beautiful minimal ui: san francisco font, all lowercase
- fallback strategy: transcribe separately if mixing fails

**key decisions from planning session**:
- test multiple services to find best quality/cost/speed balance
- mp3 conversion essential (wav ~10mb/min → mp3 ~1mb/min)
- corrections track both wrong and right: "wikus" → "vikas"
- admin vs regular user modes for testing vs production

**Solution**: Use ffmpeg directly with AVFoundation

### 2. Speaker Diarization
**Problem**: Whisper API doesn't provide speaker labels for audio
**Solutions**:
- Use AssemblyAI ($0.015/min with speakers)
- Add pyannote for speaker detection
- Simple heuristics based on pauses

### 3. Memory Usage  
**Issue**: 98% memory usage during tests - ✅ RESOLVED
**Root Cause**: Audio chunks accumulated in memory during recording

**Memory Usage Analysis:**
- **Audio format**: 16kHz mono 16-bit = 32KB/second
- **Single 60-minute recording**:
  - Before: 60min × 32KB/s = 115MB kept in RAM during recording
  - After: ~320KB max (only 2 chunks in memory at any time)
  - **Savings**: 99.7% memory reduction per recording
- **Daily usage (5 × 60min recordings)**:
  - Before: 5 × 115MB = 575MB RAM usage during active recordings
  - After: 5 × 320KB = 1.6MB RAM usage during active recordings  
  - **Total savings**: 573.4MB less memory usage

**Solution**: Stream-to-disk architecture - chunks written directly to temp file
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE - Production ready, tested with multiple recordings

### 4. WER Improvement
**Current**: ~15% WER (84.5% accuracy)
**Target**: <5% WER
**Path**: See WER_OPTIMIZATION_GUIDE.md

## Phase 1 - Milestone 3: Beta-Ready Product Experience (10-14 Days)

### 3.1.9 Clean Gemini Implementation ✅ COMPLETE
- **gemini-only pipeline** replacing whisper dependencies
- **memory optimization** with stream-to-disk architecture (99.7% reduction)
- **comprehensive stress testing** validation
- **auto-updater** deferred pending Apple Developer account
- **target:** stable, memory-efficient gemini transcription experience

### 3.2 advanced audio capture & speaker recognition ✅ COMPLETE
**milestone overview:** complete audio architecture overhaul to eliminate data loss and add speaker intelligence

**problem solved:** users were losing 10-11% of actual meeting content (2-6 minutes on longer recordings) due to unresolved 5-year-old ffmpeg bugs. competitive analysis revealed granola uses electron-audio-loopback for zero data loss + speaker recognition.

#### research phase & competitive analysis
**data loss pattern investigation:**
- confirmed progressive audio data loss during recording
- 1:00 recording → 0:50 audio (17% loss)
- 23:56 recording → 21:20 audio (10.9% loss) 
- root cause: ffmpeg bugs #4437, #11398, #4089 causing frame drops

**granola architecture discovery:**
- confirmed: granola is electron app (not native swift)
- critical insight: granola does NOT use ffmpeg at all
- uses electron-audio-loopback for zero data loss
- our assumption "ffmpeg = industry standard" was architectural error

**industry solution research:**
- proven electron audio solutions: electron-audio-loopback, naudiodon, node-miniaudio
- successful electron meeting apps bypass ffmpeg entirely
- native electron getDisplayMedia() apis provide reliable capture

#### implementation journey
**initial attempt: audiocaptureloopback class (failed)**
- attempted to implement electron-audio-loopback in main process
- hit main process limitation: getDisplayMedia() requires renderer context
- learned electron security model requires user gesture in renderer

**architectural restructure: ipc-based renderer solution**
- moved audio capture to renderer process with ipc communication
- implemented dual-stream capture architecture
- proper electron security model with user-initiated media access

**airpods microphone compatibility issue**
- electron-audio-loopback defaulting to wrong audio device
- airpods microphone not being selected automatically
- solution: explicit getUserMedia device selection with device enumeration

**dual-stream capture challenge**
- working dual-stream capture: microphone + system audio simultaneously
- simple concatenation destroyed temporal relationships between streams
- industry research on multi-track approaches (granola, obs, zoom)

**final implementation: professional multi-track webm**
- temporal interleaving of audio streams preserving timing relationships
- professional multi-track webm output compatible with media players
- maintains speaker separation while preserving synchronization

#### technical achievements
**zero audio data loss:**
- replaced ffmpeg + avfoundation with electron-audio-loopback
- eliminated 5-year-old ffmpeg bugs causing progressive timing loss
- 100% duration accuracy: recording time = audio content time

**dual-stream capture (granola's approach):**
- simultaneous microphone (user) + system audio (participants) capture
- automatic speaker labeling: mic = "me", system = "them" 
- distinguishes user speech from other participants without meeting bots

**airpods compatibility:**
- device enumeration and explicit device selection
- seamless switching between built-in and bluetooth microphones
- robust device change handling during recording sessions

**professional multi-track output:**
- temporal interleaving preserving audio stream relationships
- multi-track webm format compatible with standard media players
- speaker identification maintained throughout processing pipeline

**memory optimization maintained:**
- preserved 99.7% memory reduction from milestone 3.1.9
- efficient mediarecorder segments with temporal synchronization
- max 10mb peak usage vs previous 100mb+ approach

#### technical implementation
```javascript
// dual-stream architecture
const AudioCaptureLoopback = require('./src/audio/audioCaptureLoopback');
const capture = new AudioCaptureLoopback();

// ipc-based renderer communication
ipcMain.handle('start-recording-dual-stream', async () => {
  return await capture.startRecording();
});

// temporal interleaving for multi-track output
const interleavedBuffer = temporallyInterleaveStreams(micChunks, systemChunks);
const professionalWebM = createMultiTrackWebM(interleavedBuffer);
```

#### validation results

- **google oauth implementation** in electron (web flow)
- **user schema design** and session management
- **recordings sync** to cloud storage
- **target:** user accounts and data persistence foundation

### 3.3.5 mixed audio pivot - critical architectural simplification (2-3 days) 
**the breakthrough (2025-09-03):** after a week of struggling with dual-file temporal alignment, discovered that native mixed audio is the industry standard solution

**problem we were solving wrong:**
- dual-file approach (mic + system separate) caused temporal alignment issues
- gemini couldn't properly merge the streams chronologically
- complex prompting strategies failed to fix the fundamental problem
- we were fighting against what transcription services expect

**the revelation:**
- macos naturally mixes audio at hardware level via coreaudio
- `getDisplayMedia({ audio: true })` gives us perfectly mixed audio
- this is what zoom, teams, loom, and every major app uses
- transcription services are designed for mixed audio + speaker diarization

**implementation plan (file-based approach):**
1. **switch to mixed audio capture with optimizations** (0.5 days)
   - use native getdisplaymedia for single mixed stream
   - implement stream-to-disk for memory efficiency
   - circular buffer for ui waveform (last 30 seconds only)
   - error recovery with retry logic
   - performance monitoring built-in
   - optimal settings: 48khz mono, 128kbps opus, 2-second chunks

2. **cleanup dual-file code** (1 day)
   - remove audioloopbackrenderer dual-stream logic
   - remove audioloopbackrendererfixed
   - remove stereo merge attempts
   - simplify ipc communication to single file
   - clean up file handling
   - estimated: -500 lines of code

3. **integrate speaker diarization** (1 day)
   - deepgram with `diarize: true`, nova-2 model
   - assemblyai with `speaker_labels: true`
   - gemini with simplified mixed audio prompt
   - implement smart speaker identification (main speaker = @me)
   - compare accuracy across all three services

4. **test with real meetings** (0.5 days)
   - simple: continuous playback + speaking
   - complex: play, pause, speak, resume patterns
   - long recordings: 30-60 minutes memory test
   - edge cases: silence, overlapping speech
   - measure: accuracy, memory usage, performance

**expected outcomes:**
- eliminate all temporal alignment issues (100% guaranteed)
- simplify codebase by ~500 lines
- improve transcription accuracy to 90%+
- work naturally with all transcription services
- memory usage <50mb for 60-minute recordings
- zero memory leaks with proper cleanup
- resilient to device/permission issues

## Technical Research: Supabase vs Firebase

### Decision: Supabase Pro ($25/month)

**cost analysis at scale:**
- **100 users:** supabase $25/month vs firebase $40-60/month
- **1,000 users:** supabase $25-50/month vs firebase $200-400/month  
- **10,000 users:** supabase $100-200/month vs firebase $2000+/month

**key advantages:**
- **fixed pricing model** vs firebase's expensive usage-based costs
- **better for large files** (50gb uploads vs firebase's expensive storage/egress)
- **postgresql database** perfect for meeting→user→transcript relationships
- **unified authentication** included in base pricing
- **open-source** foundation prevents vendor lock-in

**architecture decision:**
- **metadata in postgres:** user accounts, meeting records, subscription status
- **large files in supabase storage:** audio files, full transcripts, summaries
- **single provider simplicity** vs multi-service complexity

## Session Context for Resume
**CRITICAL**: Always use FFmpeg + AVFoundation approach. Do NOT try AudioTee, osx-audio, or other experimental libraries - they don't work for microphone capture.

**Working Pipeline**:
```javascript
// This works perfectly:
const ffmpegArgs = [
    '-f', 'avfoundation',
    '-i', ':0',  // Microphone
    '-f', 's16le',
    '-acodec', 'pcm_s16le',
    '-ar', '16000',
    '-ac', '1',
    '-loglevel', 'error',
    '-'
];
```

## Important Discoveries
1. **AudioTee** only captures system audio, not microphone
2. **node-mac-recorder** creates incompatible MP4 files
3. **Whisper API** doesn't support speaker diarization for audio
4. **FFmpeg + AVFoundation** is the proven solution used by all major apps
5. **5-second chunks** provide good balance of latency and context
6. **Cost**: $0.30-0.40/hour is sustainable for most use cases

## Test Results Archive
- `validation_1755932041000`: 1-min test, 100% success, 68 words
- `file_test_1756036758188`: Twitter video, 702 words, ~84.5% accuracy

## Development Workflow: Git Branching Strategy

### New Approach (Following Industry Best Practices)
- **main/master branch:** stable, production-ready releases only (v1.0, v1.1, etc.)
- **develop branch:** integration branch for all features in development  
- **feature/milestone-x-y:** individual feature branches off develop

### Benefits
- **main stays stable** for users downloading releases
- **parallel development** of multiple features
- **proper release management** with version tags
- **hotfix capability** without breaking ongoing development

### Implementation
```bash
# create develop branch from current main
git checkout -b develop
git push -u origin develop

# future feature work
git checkout develop
git checkout -b feature/milestone-3-packaging
# ... work on feature ...
git checkout develop
git merge feature/milestone-3-packaging
```

## Current Session Context (2025-08-26)

### Technical Decisions Made Today
1. **Backend Selection:** supabase pro ($25/month) over firebase for cost efficiency and postgresql database
2. **Git Workflow:** implemented main/develop/feature branching with versioning: v0.1 (m1), v0.2 (m2), v0.25 (m2.5), v0.3 (m3)
3. **Milestone 3 Priority Reordering:** app packaging first → reliability → ui → auth → payments (user's strategic insight)
4. **Pricing Strategy:** copy granola's model - free: 10 meetings, pro: $25/month unlimited
5. **Repository Updates:** updated readme.md, created develop branch, tagged v0.25, created github release

### Key Insights from Friend's Git Advice
- proper branching strategy essential for beta deployment
- main branch = stable releases only
- develop branch = integration of all features
- feature branches = individual milestone work
- enables parallel development and proper release management

### Current State
- **branch:** develop (with milestone 3/4 roadmap)
- **tagged:** v0.25 (milestone 2.5 complete)  
- **next:** start feature/milestone-3-packaging branch for electron-builder setup
- **licensing:** mit for now, business source license research postponed until actual users

### Session Continuity Notes
- readme.md updated to reflect gemini end-to-end breakthrough vs basic meeting tools
- project-state.md contains comprehensive milestone 3/4 plans and supabase research
- git workflow established with proper version tagging scheme
- ready to begin milestone 3.1: app packaging (days 1-3 of 14-day beta-ready plan)

## Current Session Context (2025-08-27)

### milestone 3.1 progress: app packaging & distribution

**issue discovered & resolved: electron-builder stack overflow**
- **problem**: electron-builder v26.0.12 had infinite recursion bug in nodeModulesCollector
- **failed attempts**: 
  - file exclusion patterns in package.json
  - fresh node_modules installation
  - minimal configuration approach
- **solution**: downgraded to electron-builder v24.13.3 (stable version)
- **result**: successful .dmg and .zip builds at ~112MB each

**version correction**: updated from incorrect 1.0.1 → correct v0.3.0 (milestone 3)

**auto-updater implementation completed:**
- installed electron-updater v6.6.2 with github releases integration

## Phase 1 - Milestone 3.1.9: Clean Gemini End-to-End Implementation 🚀

### Critical Learning & Course Correction
**Problem Identified**: milestone 2.5 was marked complete but integration was broken
- gemini end-to-end method (`processAudioEndToEnd`) existed but was never called by main.js
- whisper live transcription still running (should have been removed)
- recording workflow got stuck in "generating summary" state
- dual pipeline complexity created version conflicts and ui sync issues

**Solution**: clean implementation with gemini-only pipeline

### Core Architecture Changes
**Pipeline Simplification**:
- ❌ **Remove entirely**: whisper api, live transcription, real-time chunks
- ✅ **Single pipeline**: audio file → gemini 2.5 flash → transcript + summary
- ✅ **Clean main.js**: record → save audio → gemini processing → ui update

### User Experience Design  
**Recording Flow**:
1. **Single Toggle Button**: "start recording" ↔ "stop recording" 
2. **Immediate Sidebar Meeting**: appears when recording starts with timer
3. **Visual Recording State**: 
   - main screen: timer + beautiful wave animation
   - sidebar meeting: timer + smaller wave animation
4. **No Live Transcription**: clean, distraction-free recording

**Post-Recording Flow**:
1. **Stop → Welcome Message**: "your transcript and summary will be here soon, v"
2. **Tabs with Loading States**: show transcript and summary tabs immediately
3. **Sequential Population**: transcript appears first, then summary (as generated)
4. **User Name**: hardcoded as "v" until authentication in later milestone

### Cost Tracking Enhancement
**Comprehensive Cost Analytics**:
- total historical spend (all whisper + gemini costs from past sessions)
- current meeting cost (gemini end-to-end processing) 
- average cost per meeting (total spend ÷ number of meetings)
- display in status bar area

### Technical Implementation Tasks
1. **Remove Whisper Dependencies**: clean removal of whisperTranscription.js usage
2. **Integrate Gemini Pipeline**: main.js calls `processAudioEndToEnd` method  
3. **UI Redesign**: remove live transcript area, add wave animations
4. **Cost System**: aggregate historical costs, calculate averages
5. **Stress Test Milestone 3.1**: auto-updater, icons, installation workflows

### Success Criteria
- ✅ single button recording workflow
- ✅ clean gemini-only processing (no whisper)
- ✅ beautiful recording animations and states
- ✅ reliable meeting completion and sidebar population  
- ✅ comprehensive cost tracking with averages
- ✅ memory optimization with stream-to-disk architecture (99.7% reduction)
- ✅ comprehensive stress testing completed successfully
- 🔄 auto-updater deferred to later milestone 3 (pending Apple Developer account)

### Stress Testing Results (2025-08-28)
**Memory Optimization**: Stream-to-disk architecture validated
- Multiple consecutive recordings: No memory accumulation
- Stable ~161MB total app memory usage regardless of recording count
- 99.7% reduction from previous in-memory approach verified

**Gemini Pipeline Reliability**: 100% success rate across all test scenarios
- Various recording lengths (10s-2min): All processed accurately
- Duration calculation accuracy: Fixed and working correctly
- UI synchronization: Smooth operation under load
- Cost tracking: Fixed $0.00 display issue, proper calculation implemented

**Edge Case Handling**: Robust state management
- Recording protection: Prevents conflicts during rapid interactions
- File cleanup: Temp files properly managed
- Audio timing: 10s FFmpeg startup delay documented as normal behavior

**MILESTONE 3.1.9 COMPLETE AND PRODUCTION-READY** ✅

## Critical Audio Data Loss Investigation (2025-08-29)

### data loss pattern confirmed
**progressive audio data loss during recording:**
- 1:00 recording → 0:50 audio (10s loss, 17% data loss)
- 5:08 recording → 4:34 audio (34s loss, 11% data loss) 
- 7:31 recording → 6:41 audio (50s loss, 11% data loss)
- 23:56 recording → 21:20 audio (2:36 loss, 10.9% data loss)
- 33:13 recording → 29:35 audio (3:38 loss, 10.8% data loss)

### root cause identified: ffmpeg avfoundation bugs
**confirmed actual data loss, not calculation error:**
- ffprobe analysis: wav files genuinely contain less audio than recording time
- system timer accurate (Date.now() measurements correct)
- ffmpeg + avfoundation dropping audio frames during capture

**5-year-old unresolved ffmpeg bugs:**
- bug #4437: race condition in captureOutput:didOutputSampleBuffer callback
- bug #11398: missing audio samples during buffer overflows
- bug #4089: avfoundation delays and timing drift issues

### industry solution research breakthrough
**granola architecture discovery:**
- confirmed: granola is electron app (not native swift)
- critical insight: granola does NOT use ffmpeg at all
- successful electron meeting apps use electron-audio-loopback or native node modules
- our assumption "ffmpeg = industry standard" was wrong

**proven electron audio solutions:**
1. **electron-audio-loopback**: uses native electron getDisplayMedia() apis, no data loss
2. **native node modules**: naudiodon, node-miniaudio bypass ffmpeg entirely  
3. **hybrid approaches**: automatic fallback from electron apis to optimized ffmpeg

### impact assessment
**critical data loss issue:**
- **users losing actual meeting content**: 10-11% of speech missing from audio files
- **transcript incomplete**: gemini processes truncated audio, missing final portions
- **duration mismatch**: causes gemini timestamp confusion and summary parsing failures
- **production blocker**: cannot ship with 10% content loss

### immediate solution path
**milestone 3.2 priority upgrade:**
- implement electron-audio-loopback replacement for ffmpeg
- requires electron >= 31.0.1 (check current version)
- maintains current architecture but eliminates data loss
- fallback to optimized ffmpeg parameters if electron method fails

**technical implementation:**
```javascript
const { getLoopbackAudioMediaStream } = require('electron-audio-loopback');
const stream = await getLoopbackAudioMediaStream({
  systemAudio: false,
  microphone: true
});
```

### lessons learned
**architecture decision errors:**
- assumed ffmpeg + avfoundation = native macos audio capture
- confused cross-platform wrapper with direct api usage
- didn't investigate successful competitor technical stacks deeply enough
- prioritized development convenience over production reliability

**research methodology improvements:**
- verify competitor tech stacks before architectural decisions
- test data integrity early in development cycle
- implement continuous audio quality monitoring
- separate timing display issues from actual data loss problems

---

## Current Session Context (2025-08-31)

### milestone 3.2 status: ✅ COMPLETE

**major achievements:**
- ✅ **zero data loss**: electron-audio-loopback implementation eliminates ffmpeg 10-11% data loss
- ✅ **dual-stream intelligence**: separate microphone + system audio files for speaker identification

- production-ready dual-stream webm output
- eliminated critical production blocker (data loss issue)

### strategic roadmap revision - human intelligence priority

**original milestone sequence revised to prioritize differentiation:**

### milestone 3.3: transcript reliability - zero content loss (CRITICAL PRIORITY)
**foundation trust before differentiation:**
- fix audio quality threshold issues preventing transcript segments
- improve speaker identification for rapid speaker transitions  
- establish comprehensive reliability testing protocol (10-20-30-50 recordings)
- achieve consistent capture across varying lengths and edge cases
- zero tolerance for content loss - every word must be captured
- validate 100% transcript completeness before competitive advantage work
- **timeline**: reliability first - no compromises on foundation trust
- **rationale**: 33% content loss (1+ min missing from 3-min recording) destroys user confidence

### milestone 3.4: human intelligence differentiation (moved from 3.3)
**core competitive advantage work:**
- enhanced prompts for true emotional journey transcripts
- sally rooney-style relationship dynamics in summaries  
- speaker personality detection and communication patterns
- advanced @speaker references, topic emphasis, emotional indicators
- ui performance optimization for large transcripts
- **timeline**: extensive work, quality over speed approach
- **prerequisite**: complete confidence in transcript reliability from 3.3

### milestone 3.4.1: testflight preparation 
**professional beta distribution:**
- apple developer account setup ($99/year)
- code signing and testflight configuration
- privacy policy and app store compliance
- user tier implementation (admin vs regular user modes)
- **outcome**: professional beta testing vs manual .dmg sharing

### milestone 3.5: authentication & backend (previously 3.4)
**simplified scope - beta user management:**
- user accounts foundation with tier differentiation  
- cloud storage for transcripts/recordings
- basic sync functionality
- **focus**: supporting beta users, not full production auth

### milestone 3.6: enhanced ui + beta polish (previously 3.5)
**showcasing human intelligence capabilities:**
- onboarding flow highlighting our differentiation
- better recording management and search
- settings/account integration
- **goal**: demonstrate competitive advantage to beta users

### milestone 3.7: payment integration + production ready (previously 3.6)
**revenue foundation:**
- stripe setup with usage-based pricing model
- beta feedback collection and iteration
- final reliability and polish
- **target**: production-ready app with proven differentiation

### strategic insights from comprehensive analysis + sync testing

**foundation assessment - reliability concerns identified:**
- ✅ **fast**: single gemini api (2.7x faster than multi-step)
- ✅ **capture**: zero data loss at hardware level, dual-stream sync fixed
- ❌ **processing reliability**: 33% content loss due to audio quality thresholds
- ❌ **speaker identification**: rapid transitions causing misattribution
- **conclusion**: not ready for differentiation - reliability must come first

**security considerations (deferred appropriately):**
- nodeintegration: safe for current local html usage, monitor for external content
- encryption: address with cloud architecture in 3.4+  
- api keys: properly secured via .env (not committed)

**code quality (monitor during 3.3):**
- renderer.js size (1135 lines): split if major changes needed
- ipc complexity: reassess if issues arise during development
- error handling: comprehensive coverage in place

### development practices established
**git workflow:**
- milestone-based version tagging (0.3.2 → 0.3.3)
- lowercase commit messages with what+why format
- regular readme.md updates reflecting current capabilities
- project-state.md comprehensive progress tracking

**collaborative approach:**
- strategic thinking sessions before milestone transitions
- extensive user testing parallel to development work
- quality over speed - get differentiation right first
- verify/confirm before marking tasks complete

**milestone 3.2 completion validation:**
- ✅ **temporal sync fix implemented**: simultaneous recorder starts + explicit gemini timeline instructions
- ✅ **sync issue resolved**: system audio content now appears in transcripts vs complete loss
- ❌ **quality threshold issues discovered**: 33% content loss in 3-min test (1+ min missing)
- ❌ **speaker identification problems**: rapid speaker transitions misattributed

**milestone 3.3 progress - transcript reliability:**

**diagnostic breakthroughs achieved:**
- ✅ **root cause identified**: timestamp hard stop + gemini processing drift = content truncation
- ✅ **timestamp buffer fix**: 60-second buffer prevents artificial cutoff (captures missing voice segments)
- ✅ **non-deterministic behavior confirmed**: identical inputs produce different outputs (consistency issue)
- ✅ **community research completed**: identified temperature/seed, system instructions, reasoning approaches

**timeline expansion investigation & solution:**
- ✅ **gemini timestamp drift confirmed**: 3:47 recording → 4:18-4:45 timestamps (unpredictable expansion)
- ✅ **deterministic config implemented**: temperature=0, seed, maxTokens=32768 for consistency
- ✅ **temporal constraint testing**: explicit duration limits prevent expansion but cause content loss
- ✅ **fundamental insight discovered**: temporal constraints vs content completeness are incompatible

**critical product realization - timestamps are counterproductive:**
- **value misalignment**: core product = human intelligence summaries, not forensic timestamps
- **reliability paradox**: accurate timestamps increase trust marginally, inaccurate ones destroy trust entirely
- **technical reality**: gemini captures ALL content when unconstrained, timestamp drift is only remaining issue
- **competitive insight**: granola emphasizes summary, transcript secondary (no timestamp obsession)
- **user behavior**: people remember "what was decided" not "when it was said at 2:34"

**strategic pivot - timestamp removal approach:**
- **eliminate timestamps entirely**: focus on natural conversation flow capture
- **content-first processing**: "speaker by speaker, line by line as it ebbed and flowed"
- **conversation intelligence**: capture meeting dynamics without artificial time constraints
- **trust through completeness**: 100% content capture > precise but incomplete timestamps
- **better summary material**: gemini understands context better without timestamp distractions

**breakthrough achievement - timestamp removal success:**
- ✅ **complete timestamp logic removal**: eliminated all temporal constraints and duration limits
- ✅ **natural conversation format**: implemented @speaker: format focusing on conversation flow
- ✅ **100% content capture validated**: final 20-30 seconds now perfectly captured including youtube summary and airpods removal
- ✅ **parsing logic updated**: supports both timestamp and natural conversation formats
- ✅ **speaker identification improved**: @me correctly identified throughout entire recording
- ✅ **deterministic processing maintained**: temperature=0, seed, maxTokens for consistency

**milestone 3.3 status: ✅ COMPLETE - transcript reliability achieved**
- **foundation trust established**: zero content loss across test scenarios
- **natural conversation intelligence**: gemini focuses on understanding vs artificial timing
- **competitive advantage foundation**: ready for human intelligence differentiation work
- **user value alignment**: content completeness over forensic timestamps
- **strategic product insight validated**: timestamps were counterproductive to core value proposition

**transcript quality assessment:**
- **content completeness**: 100% - captures every spoken word from start to finish
- **speaker identification**: excellent - clear @me vs @speaker1/2 distinction maintained
- **conversation flow**: natural - follows actual speaking patterns and transitions
- **readability**: superior - clean format without timestamp clutter
- **trust factor**: high - users see complete content without concerning time drift

**comprehensive reliability investigation completed:**
- ✅ **confirmed audio capture reliability**: electron-audio-loopback captures complete content in both streams
- ✅ **verified file integrity**: both microphone.webm and system.webm contain full 12:27 of content 
- ✅ **identified root cause**: gemini 2.5 flash has fundamental non-deterministic behavior with dual-stream audio
- ✅ **tested across interfaces**: google ai studio exhibits same inconsistencies with identical files/prompts
- ✅ **deterministic controls insufficient**: temperature=0, seed provide structural consistency but not content completeness
- ✅ **ui improvements successful**: clean chronological speaker lines with green labels, improved readability

**reliability patterns discovered:**
- **content capture**: generally 80-90% complete across attempts
- **chronological ordering**: systematic dual-stream processing limitations
- **speaker identification**: device switching causes @me attribution confusion 
- **missing segments**: inconsistent - same sections appear/disappear between processing attempts
- **processing consistency**: structural decisions stable, fine-grained transcription varies

**strategic pivot opportunity identified:**
- **dual-stream complexity hypothesis**: sending two files simultaneously may increase inconsistency
- **proposed single-stream approach**: process files individually, merge outputs programmatically
- **potential benefits**: simpler gemini processing, more predictable behavior, maintained content sources

**milestone 3.3 status: foundation established, ready for reliability optimization or human intelligence differentiation**

### deepgram nova-3 investigation & industry research (2025-09-02)

**comprehensive transcription service evaluation:**
- **tested deepgram nova-3**: industry-leading 54.2% wer reduction claims, $0.26/hour pricing
- **implemented multichannel approach**: ffmpeg stereo webm creation (left=mic, right=system)
- **results disappointing**: similar content loss patterns to gemini, missing system audio segments
- **file size issues**: wav format created 143mb files (15x larger), webm stereo only 8.8mb
- **separate file processing tested**: better results (17k vs 8.7k characters) but still incomplete
- **cost reality**: $0.11 actual vs $0.054 calculated (2x expected cost)

**critical industry research - granola success analysis:**
- **dual transcription services**: granola uses BOTH deepgram AND assemblyai (redundancy approach)
- **no audio files created**: streams raw audio directly to services (no compression artifacts)
- **core audio api**: native macos implementation vs electron abstraction layer
- **real-time streaming**: eliminates file i/o, compression cycles, timing drift
- **privacy by design**: no audio/video recording, only transcripts saved

**root cause analysis - why we're struggling:**
1. **audio intelligibility issue**: content exists in files but services can't understand it
   - low signal-to-noise ratio when airpods removed
   - phase cancellation between overlapping audio sources
   - acoustic coupling: mic picks up speakers → muddy signal
   - webm compression artifacts masking speech frequencies

2. **architectural differences from granola:**
   - **us**: electron → record to webm → process files → transcribe
   - **granola**: core audio → stream raw pcm → real-time transcription
   - compression/decompression cycle degrades quality
   - file-based approach introduces timing issues

3. **evidence of fundamental audio quality problem:**
   - both gemini AND deepgram lose same content
   - stereo file contains everything when listened to
   - transcription services can't extract what human ears can hear
   - consistent 33-50% content loss across all approaches

**airpods switching creates acoustic nightmare:**
```
airpods on:  mic → clean signal → good transcription
             system → via airpods → clean → good

airpods off: mic → picks up speakers → muddy signal + echo
             system → through speakers → room reverb → phase issues
             
result: overlapping audio becomes unintelligible to ai
```

**immediate action plan - wav format test:**
- **hypothesis**: webm lossy compression (64-128 kbps) losing critical frequency data
- **test approach**: switch to uncompressed wav (pcm) format
- **expected improvement**: 20-40% better accuracy if compression is the issue
- **diagnostic value**: if wav still loses content, problem is acoustic not digital

**lessons learned:**
- multichannel processing doesn't solve fundamental audio quality issues
- both gemini and deepgram struggle with same underlying problems
- streaming vs file-based is architectural difference, not just optimization
- redundancy (multiple services) might be necessary for reliability
- acoustic environment matters more than we realized

**milestone 3.3 status: BREAKTHROUGH - native mixed audio is the solution**

**critical pivot (2025-09-03)**: discovered that native mixed audio capture solves all temporal alignment issues. dual-file approach was fundamentally flawed. see milestone 3.3.5 for implementation plan.

### milestone 3.3(a): improvement plan - achieving 90% accuracy with current architecture

**approach**: incremental improvements without architectural changes
**timeline**: 6-9 days total
**cost**: same as current ($0.054/hour)

**phase 1: immediate improvements (1-2 days)**
1. stereo merge at capture time (highest priority)
   - single file with left=mic, right=system
   - perfect temporal alignment
   - expected: 20-30% accuracy improvement

2. audio preprocessing pipeline
   - noise gate, normalization
   - wav conversion if needed
   - expected: 10-15% improvement

3. intelligent device detection
   - monitor airpods removal
   - handle switching gracefully
   - expected: prevent 30% loss from device changes

**phase 2: dual-service redundancy (2-3 days)**
- parallel gemini + deepgram processing
- confidence-based merging
- expected: 15-20% better completeness

**phase 3: advanced audio (3-4 days)**
- voice activity detection (vad)
- echo cancellation
- spectral noise reduction
- expected: 10-15% improvement

**success metrics:**
- target: 85-90% accuracy (up from 50-70%)
- acceptable threshold: 85%

### milestone 3.3(b): architectural pivot - core audio with file-based or streaming

**approach**: native core audio apis for pristine capture
**timeline**: 7-10 days for file-based
**cost**: same for files ($0.054/hour), 28x for streaming ($1.52/hour)

**two implementation options:**
1. **file-based (recommended)**: core audio → wav files → batch transcription
2. **streaming (if needed)**: core audio → stream to services → real-time

**collaborative development approach:**
- no xcode ide needed (just command line tools)
- no c++ learning required (assistant writes it)
- same electron packaging
- we build together

**implementation phases:**
1. core audio capture module (3-4 days)
2a. file-based processing (2 days) OR
2b. streaming implementation (3-4 days)

**when to choose:**
- 3.3(a) if quick results needed (2-3 days)
- 3.3(b) if 3.3(a) achieves <80% accuracy

### milestone 3.3(a) implementation progress (2025-09-02)

**attempted implementations:**
1. ✅ increased bitrate to 256kbps (completed)
2. ❌ stereo merge at capture - attempted wrong approach (see below)
3. ✅ disabled device switching (prevented crashes)
4. ✅ reduced segment duration to 5s (memory management)
5. ✅ fixed terminal timeout confusion (not app crash)

**stereo merge confusion - critical learning:**
- **what we tried**: post-processing merge after recording stops
- **why it failed**: web audio api cannot decode webm/opus
- **what actually happened**: function always returns null, no stereo file created
- **correct approach**: real-time stream merging before recording

**diagnostic discoveries:**
- app wasn't crashing, terminal was timing out after 2 minutes
- single-stream processing was accidentally enabled (caused bad transcripts)
- reduce() operations on blobs not causing issues
- browser's ondevicechange events unreliable for airpods removal
- 3-6 second recording delay was cutting off initial audio

**current working state:**
- dual-file approach: 67-100% accuracy when properly configured
- recording 3+ minutes successfully
- ready for real-time stereo implementation

### milestone 3.3(a) comprehensive audio fix (2025-09-03)

**regression root causes identified:**
- mistook terminal timeout for app crashes leading to wrong diagnosis
- segment duration change from 60s to 5s exposed timing issues
- browser ondevicechange events unreliable for airpods removal
- 3-6 second delay at recording start was cutting initial audio

**fixes implemented (audioLoopbackRendererFixed.js):**
6. ✅ eliminated 3-6 second recording start delay (immediate start)
7. ✅ fixed post-airpods audio capture (poll-based monitoring every 2s)
8. ✅ implemented robust device switching (automatic recovery)
9. ✅ comprehensive edge case handling throughout workflow
10. ✅ maintained 99.7% memory optimization from 3.1.9

**technical approach change:**
- **old**: event-based monitoring with navigator.mediaDevices.ondevicechange
- **new**: poll-based monitoring checking device state every 2 seconds
- **result**: reliable device switching detection and recovery

**testing results:**
- ✅ no initial audio loss (immediate recording start)
- ✅ post-airpods audio captured successfully  
- ✅ device switching handled robustly
- ✅ memory usage remains optimized

**next steps:**
- implement real-time stream merging (the correct way)
- test comprehensive fix with various scenarios
- measure accuracy improvements with fixed audio capture

**milestone 3.3 status: BREAKTHROUGH - programmatic aggregate devices solution**

**critical pivot (2025-09-03)**: discovered that native mixed audio capture solves all temporal alignment issues. dual-file approach was fundamentally flawed. comprehensive research led to programmatic aggregate devices as the optimal solution. see `programmatic-aggregate-mixed-audio-research-breakthrough.md` for detailed analysis.
