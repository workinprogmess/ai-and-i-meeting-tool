### core audio implementation approach
```swift
// CoreAudioManager.swift - Hardware-level mixed audio
class CoreAudioManager: ObservableObject {
    @Published var isRecording = false
    @Published var recordingDuration: TimeInterval = 0
    
    private var audioEngine = AVAudioEngine()
    private var mixerNode = AVAudioMixerNode()
    private var audioFile: AVAudioFile?
    
    func startMixedRecording() async throws -> URL {
        // 1. Get microphone input
        let micInput = audioEngine.inputNode
        
        // 2. Get system audio (via aggregate device or loopback)
        let systemInput = try await getSystemAudioInput()
        
        // 3. Mix at hardware level using AVAudioEngine
        audioEngine.attach(mixerNode)
        audioEngine.connect(micInput, to: mixerNode, format: nil)
        audioEngine.connect(systemInput, to: mixerNode, format: nil)
        
        // 4. Record mixed output to file
        let documentsURL = FileManager.default.urls(for: .documentDirectory, 
                                                   in: .userDomainMask).first!
        let fileURL = documentsURL.appendingPathComponent("recording_\(Date().timeIntervalSince1970).wav")
        
        audioFile = try AVAudioFile(forWriting: fileURL, 
                                   settings: audioFormat.settings)
        
        // 5. Install tap and start recording
        mixerNode.installTap(onBus: 0, bufferSize: 4096, format: nil) { buffer, time in
            try? self.audioFile?.write(from: buffer)
        }
        
        try audioEngine.start()
        isRecording = true
        
        return fileURL
    }
}
```

### swiftui architecture patterns
```swift
// ContentView.swift - MVVM with Combine
struct ContentView: View {
    @StateObject private var audioManager = CoreAudioManager()
    @StateObject private var dataManager = DataManager()
    @State private var selectedRecording: Recording?
    
    var body: some View {
        NavigationSplitView {
            SidebarView(recordings: dataManager.recordings,
                       selection: $selectedRecording)
        } detail: {
            if let recording = selectedRecording {
                TranscriptView(recording: recording)
            } else {
                MainView(audioManager: audioManager)
            }
        }
        .onAppear {
            dataManager.loadRecordings()
        }
    }
}
```

### transcription service integration
```swift
// GeminiService.swift - Reuse proven patterns from electron
class GeminiService: ObservableObject {
    @Published var isProcessing = false
    @Published var processingProgress: Double = 0
    
    private let costTracker = CostTracker()
    
    func transcribeAudio(_ audioURL: URL) async throws -> TranscriptionResult {
        isProcessing = true
        defer { isProcessing = false }
        
        // Convert audio to format expected by Gemini
        let audioData = try await convertAudioForAPI(audioURL)
        
        // Use exact same API patterns from electron version
        let request = GeminiRequest(
            model: "gemini-2.5-flash",
            prompt: mixedAudioTranscriptionPrompt,
            audioData: audioData
        )
        
        let response = try await apiClient.send(request)
        
        // Track costs exactly like electron version
        costTracker.recordUsage(
            inputTokens: response.usage.inputTokens,
            outputTokens: response.usage.outputTokens,
            cost: response.cost
        )
        
        return TranscriptionResult(
            transcript: response.transcript,
            summary: response.summary,
            cost: response.cost,
            processingTime: response.processingTime
        )
    }
}
```

## user experience design principles

### native mac app excellence
- **follow human interface guidelines**: consistent with system apps
- **instant responsiveness**: all ui interactions feel immediate
- **intuitive navigation**: obvious how to accomplish tasks
- **beautiful typography**: proper font hierarchy and spacing
- **subtle animations**: enhance understanding without distraction

### recording workflow optimization
```
user opens app → 
sees clean interface with large record button →
clicks record → 
immediate visual feedback (recording dot, timer) →
system audio + mic captured seamlessly →
clicks stop → 
"processing..." with progress indicator →
transcript appears automatically →
summary available in adjacent tab
```

### information architecture
```
sidebar: chronological list of recordings
├── today
│   ├── "meeting with sarah" (3:45pm)
│   └── "brainstorming call" (10:30am)  
├── yesterday
│   └── "client presentation" (2:15pm)
└── this week
    ├── "team standup" (monday)
    └── "project review" (wednesday)

main area: 
├── recording interface (when no selection)
│   ├── large record/stop button
│   ├── recording timer and status
│   └── quick settings (quality, etc)
└── transcript display (when recording selected)
    ├── transcript tab: clean text with speaker labels
    ├── summary tab: key points and insights
    └── export options: copy, save, share
```

### visual design principles
- **minimal chrome**: focus on content, not interface
- **generous whitespace**: comfortable reading experience
- **subtle depth**: appropriate use of shadows and layers
- **consistent iconography**: system icons where possible
- **accessible colors**: proper contrast ratios throughout

---

## testing strategy

### unit testing approach
- **audio functionality**: mock core audio apis for reliable testing
- **transcription service**: test with known audio samples and expected outputs
- **data management**: validate persistence, migration, and recovery
- **cost tracking**: ensure accurate calculations across all scenarios

### integration testing scenarios
- **end-to-end workflow**: record → transcribe → display → export
- **error recovery**: network failures, api errors, permission denials
- **performance testing**: long recordings, many simultaneous operations
- **device compatibility**: different audio setups, bluetooth devices

### user experience validation
- **usability testing**: can new users complete core tasks intuitively?
- **accessibility testing**: voiceover navigation, keyboard shortcuts, high contrast
- **performance perception**: does app feel fast even during heavy processing?
- **edge case handling**: graceful degradation when things go wrong

### automated testing pipeline
```swift
// Example test structure
class AudioManagerTests: XCTestCase {
    func testMixedAudioRecording() async throws {
        let audioManager = CoreAudioManager()
        
        // Test recording starts successfully
        let audioURL = try await audioManager.startMixedRecording()
        XCTAssertTrue(audioManager.isRecording)
        
        // Test recording produces valid audio file
        let audioFile = try AVAudioFile(forReading: audioURL)
        XCTAssertGreaterThan(audioFile.length, 0)
        
        // Test recording stops cleanly
        await audioManager.stopRecording()
        XCTAssertFalse(audioManager.isRecording)
    }
}
```

## risk mitigation & contingency plans

### technical risks
**core audio complexity**: 
- mitigation: start with simplest working implementation, iterate complexity
- fallback: use system's built-in aggregate device creation temporarily

**swiftui learning curve**:
- mitigation: focus on standard patterns, avoid custom complex layouts initially  
- fallback: use uikit components for complex ui if needed

**transcription api reliability**:
- mitigation: implement robust retry logic and offline queue
- fallback: support multiple transcription services (gemini, deepgram, assemblyai)

### timeline risks
**feature creep temptation**:
- mitigation: strict milestone scope, defer nice-to-haves until post-mvp
- measurement: only features essential for core workflow

**unknown platform quirks**:
- mitigation: research common gotchas, budget 20% extra time
- recovery: daily progress reviews to catch issues early

### user experience risks
**migration from electron version**:
- mitigation: export/import functionality for user data
- support: clear migration guide and transition period

**performance expectations**:  
- mitigation: establish performance benchmarks early
- validation: continuous profiling during development
